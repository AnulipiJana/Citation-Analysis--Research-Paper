"A typical communication system consists of the following five elements: (1) An information source. This can be considered to be represented mathematically by a suitable stochastic process which chooses one message from a set of possible messages. The rate R of producing information is measured by the entropy per symbol of the process. (2) An encoding or transmitting element. Mathematically this amounts to a transformation applied to the message to produce the signal, i.e., the encoded message. (3) A channel on which the signal is transmitted from transmitter to receiver. During transmission the signal may be perturbed by noise. (4) A receiving and decoding (or demodulating) device which recovers the original message from the received signal. (5) The destination of the information, e.g., the human ear (for telephony) or the eye (for television). The characteristics of the destination may determine the significant elements of the information to be transmitted. For example, with sound transmission, precise recovery of the phases of components is not required because of the insensitivity of the ear to this type of distortion.",['Claude E.

"1. Object. The aim of this paper is to present a decision procedure which seems to be as easy to use as other available procedures in quantification theory, but which is considerably stronger than the others, providing a mechanical test for a sub-species of polyadic validity which is very much broader than monadic validity.2 Of course, a test for polyadic validity in general is out of the question, but the present test's limits, short of polyadic validity, are not known. That is, of all the polyadically valid schemata which have been tested, none has failed to yield decisions under this method. The material thus examined includes schemata corresponding to the cases of all absolute metatheorems in ML's3 Chapters II and III, and five polyadic samples4 from MeL. The handiness of this test is illustrated by sample applications in ? 3 below. 2. Terminology. The logical symbolism used here follows much the same familiar pattern as that of MeL. Thus 'p' through 't' represent, or stand in place of, statements, and 'F', 'G', 'H', 'J', and 'K' similarly represent predicates.5 'ip', 'q', 'Gx', 'Hx', 'Hxyz', and so on, are schemata, and the results of putting schemata in the blanks of '( . )' or '( V )', or after I', or after quantifiers such as '(x)', '(y)', and so on, are schemata in turn. Schemata of the last four kinds are conjuncts, disjuncts, negations, and quanti/ications, respectively. Then 'D', and other familiar propositional connectives are defined as usual, in terms of these three propositional symbols. Thus '(p D q)' abbreviates '(u.'p V q)', and '(p = q)' abbreviates '(p D q qD :P5)'. As usual, '(3x)', '(3y)' and the like abbreviate ' .'(x) A', '-(y)'-, and so on, correspondingly. A quantifier-occurrence is said to cover every part of the schema-occurrence to which it is prefixed. A quantifier-occurrence binds its own variable-occurrence, and also any unbound occurrences of its variable which",['Robert L.

"Many business, economic, and engineering problems involve devising means of achieving optimal results in the face of a series of restrictions. These restrictions may assume a variety of forms. Plant or machine capacities, labor requirements, market restrictions, procedural and policy conditions, financial limitations, etc., are examples common to many kinds of business. Other examples may be specialized to more narrow groups of firms. It is, therefore, desirable to develop modes of attacking such problems which will provide a general and economical method of (1) determining best or optimal solutions within the stipulated limitations and (2) assessing the economic cost of the restrictions and, therefore, the worthwhileness of altering them.

"This paper is an attempt to clarify some aspects of the approach to experimentation suggested by the author in a recent publication in the Philosophical Magazine, (hereafter referred to as P.M.). The concept of ""amount of information"" is shown to have three distinct senses in current literature. Two of these are definable as numerical features of the logical pattern of propositional relations which we make to represent a result. The third measures the relative unexpectedness of the pattern, which may or may not be connected with its numerical features. Since logical patterns can be built up from discrete quantal elements, the information enabling them to be built is quantised by our use of 'yes-or-no' logical forms as scientific statements. The number of discrete 'elementary propositions' in a given description cannot be altered by any complete reformulation. This is seen to be the basis of our ability to 'barter' certain quantities for one another - e.g. accuracy for speed of response in a galvanometer or a communication-channel. The term ""selective information"" is suggested to distinguish the third sense of 'information' (called amount of detail in P.M.) from the first two, whioh measure respectively the number of independent features (structural information) and the weight of evidence or precision (metrical information) in a result. 'Selective information' is the measure of information currently used by communication engineers, and a distinguishing title appears to be essential. From the standpoint here adopted the various uncertainty-relations of physics illustrate a general axiom expressing the quantal nature of the logical descriptions which we make. Some other practical and theoretical implications of the theory are examined.",['D. M.

"In any branch of applied mathematics, the vague and ambiguous concepts of a physical problem are given a more refined and idealized meaning. In information theory, one of the basic notions is that of the amount of information associated with a given situation. ""Information"" here, although related to the everyday meaning of the word, should not be confused with it. In everyday usage, information usually implies something about the semantic content of a message.

"The word ""information"" has been given many different meanings by various writers in the general field of information theory. It is likely that at least a number of these will prove sufficiently useful in certain applications to deserve further study and permanent recognition. It is hardly to be expected that a single concept of information would satisfactorily account for the numerous possible applications of this general field. The present note outlines a new approach to information theory which is aimed specifically at the analysis of certain communication problems in which there exist a number of information sources simultaneously in operation. A typical example is that of a simple communication channel with a feedback path from the receiving point to the transmitting point. The problem is to make use of the feedback information for improving forward transmission, and to determine the forward channel capacity when the best possible use is made of this feedback information. Another more general problem is that of a communication system consisting of a large number of transmitting and receiving points with some type of interconnection network between the various points. The problem here is to formulate the best systems design whereby, in some sense, the best overall use of the available facilities is made. While the analysis sketched here has not yet proceeded to the point or a complete solution of these problems, partial answers have been found and it is believed that a complete solution may be possible.",['Claude E.

Two specific cases of signal detection involving uncertainty in the frequency of a sound signal are compared with the case of the signal-known-exactly. In the first case the signal is either of two known frequencies; in the second case the signal is any frequency within a given range.

Evidence is presented that supports the existence of such a mechanism. Estimates of the bandwidth end seen-rate of the receiver are included.,"['Wilson P. Tanner', 'Robert Z.

"A relation between the distribution of customer-servicing times and that of customer-waiting times is derived for the case of a single-channel queue with random arrivals and the rule of “first come, first served” establishing the order of service. The queue is assumed to be in a state of statistical equilibrium. The relation holds for a large class of the servicing-time distributions that occur in practice, in particular the cases of constant, exponential, and Type III Pearson servicing times. The derivation takes into account changes in the magnitude of demand from customer to customer, changes that may exist in many of the situations in which the theory is likely to be applied. Using the theory, the characteristics of the waiting-time distributions associated with several specific types of servicing-time distributions are discussed. It is shown that if it is possible to make the right sort of alterations in servicing-time distributions considerable reduction in customer waiting times can be made. The an...",['D. P.

"The stochastic properties of waiting lines may be analyzed by a two-stage process: first solving the time-dependent equations for the state probabilities and then utilising these transient solutions to obtain the auto-correlation function for queue length and the root-mean-square frequency spectrum of its fluctuations from mean length. The procedure is worked out in detail for the one-channel, exponential service facility with Poisson arrivals, and the basic solutions for the m-channel exponential service case are given. The analysis indicates that the transient behavior of the queue length n(t) may be measured by a “relaxation time,” the mean time any deviation of n(t) away from its mean value L takes to return (1/e) of the way back to L. This relaxation time increases as (1 − ρ)−2 as the utilization factor ρ approaches unity, whereas the mean length L increases as (1 − ρ)−1. In other words, as saturation of the facility is approached, the mean length of line increases; but, what is often more detrimenta...",['Philip M.

"A detailed analysis of the general binary channel is given, with special reference to capacity (both separately and in cascade), input and output symbol distributions, and probability of error. The infinite number of binary channels with the same capacity lie on double-branched equicapacity lines. Of the channels on the lower branch of a given equicapacity line, the symmetric channel has the smallest probability of error and the largest capacity in cascade, unless the capacity is small, in which case the asymmetric channel (with one noiseless symbol) has the smallest probability of error and the largest capacity in cascade. By simply reversing the designation of the output (or input) symbols, we can decrease the probability of error of any channel on the upper branch of the equi-capacity line and increase the capacity in cascade of any asymmetric channel on the upper branch. In a binary channel neither symbol should be transmitted with a probability lying outside the interval [1/e, 1 - (1/e)] if capacity is to be achieved. The maximally asymmetric input symbol distributions are approached by certain low-capacity channels. For these channels, redundancy coding permits an appreciable fraction of capacity in cascade if sufficient delay can be tolerated.",['Richard A.

"In Part I predictive coding was defined and messages, prediction, entropy, and ideal coding were discussed. In the present paper the criterion to be used for predictors for the purpose of predictive coding is defined: that predictor is optimum in the information theory (IT) sense which minimizes the entropy of the average error-term distribution. Ordered averages of distributions are defined and it is shown that if a predictor gives an ordered average error term distribution it will be a best IT predictor. Special classes of messages are considered for which a best IT predictor can easily be found, and some examples are given. The error terms which are transmitted in predictive coding are treated as if they were statistically independent. If this is indeed the case, or a good approximation, then it is still necessary to show that sequences of message terms which are statistically independent may always be coded efficiently, without impractically large memory requirements, in order to show that predictive coding may be practical and efficient in such cases. This is done in the final section of this paper.",['Peter Elias'],105,[],Predictive coding--II,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,1955,5eded567-8080-4a1b-9e33-1ca174ed5db0

"An analysis of the functional representation of the carry digits in the addition process shows that the one-megacycle circuitry of SEAC and DYSEAC can be organized logically to permit the formation of many successive carries simultaneously. The Boolean expression for any carry digit Ck can be expanded so as to be an explicit function of only the input digits of orders k to k-p+1 and of the carry digit Ck-p. Certain factorizations can then be made to simplify these expressions so that all of them fall within the limitations on the gating complexity imposed by the circuitry. A parallel adder utilizing this principle is developed which is capable of adding two 53-bit numbers in one microsecond, with relatively few additional components over those required in a parallel adder of more conventional design.","['Arnold Weinberger', 'J.

"We present a method for demonstrating the consistency of von NeumanGodel set theory E (or Zermelo set theory E') relative to various other formal set theories. When a model for a logic L1 is constructed, there are two other logics involved: L2, the system which contains the model, and L3, the metalogic in which the argument that L2 contains a model for L1 is carried out. These three systems need not of course all be distinct. In [2] L1 is E strengthened by the axiom V = L, L2 is E, and L3 is unformalized. In the present paper L1 will be either E or E'. The basic idea for proving the relative consistency of L1 with respect to some other system L2 is to construct in L2 a model for L1 similar to the model constructed in [2]. Since L2 may be some kind of type theory, the function corresponding to Gddel's function F must be modified in a suitable manner. In verifying the relativized versions of axioms of L1 in L2, we shall have to overcome certain special problems depending on the system L2 and not met with in [2]. Except for the remarks at the end of Section 2, we shall not consider the question of formalizing L3, i.e. we use intuitive logic as our metalogic. In Section 1 we illustrate the method by demonstrating the consistency of E relative to the system ML"" obtained by adding E of [4] as an axiom",['Steven Orey'],1,['425999cc-8bb8-49a7-bc22-c92ff1bdae21'],ON THE RELATIVE CONSISTENCY OF SET THEORY),Journal of Symbolic Logic,1956,df21b134-27a7-4bea-9616-1d47c41423bb

"The complexity of an electronic switching circuit is defined in a sufficiently general way so that most definitions which are presently used may be included. If ?(p, q) is the complexity of a p input q output circuit which has been minimized then we may define E(p, q) as the maximum of ?(p, q) over all p input, q output circuits. In spite of the generality of the definition of complexity one may obtain the following inequality which gives upper and lower bounds on this maximum complexity: C12r/r?E(p, q)?C22r/r where r = p+log2 q. In this expression C1 and C2 are constants independent of p and q which depend upon the definition of complexity.

Many papers have been written about the reflected binary system and it is well known in the computer field for analog-to-digital conversion. The method used in creating this system may be extended to systems of bases other than two. It is the purpose of this paper to carry this extension to its logical conclusion. The author describes how reflected systems of different bases may be composed. The equations for translating between the conventional and reflected systems are then derived. It is also demonstrated how the reflected binary system is a special case of reflected number systems and how the general case simplifies for the reflected binary case.,['Ivan Flores'],50,['14a10143-0231-42dd-a3f5-76284f92834d'],Reflected Number Systems,Ire Transactions on Electronic Computers,1956,90d1b303-e303-40e8-a17c-ff9fc0a1c98b

"Circuits for the recycling of pulses by means of a driving tube and an electromagnetic delay line have been developed, The necessary characteristic for the driving tube is shown and the effects of the delay line on the amplitude and width of pulses with respect to recycling operation are explained. Two modes of operation of these circuits are possible. One mode of operation allows any number of pulses in a recycling period, the number being limited only by the time space on the delay line. The other mode restricts the number of pulses in a recycling period to a particular value. Experimental circuits are shown which have been used as generators of pulses as short as 5 millimicroseconds at frequencies as high as 50 mc.

"A system of four diodes in a series-parallel connection is combined with dc operational amplifiers in order to accomplish a variety of computational operations. The diode circuit is equivalent to a SPST switch survey or a voltage pulse. When inserted in series with the input of an amplifier or an analog memory, the switch makes possible waveform sampling or waveform quantizing of the input voltage. Other functions, such as the fast discharge of an integrator, are also achieved. A very significant application of the diode switch in computer circuitry is its use in combination with a multiplier and a storer (a bank of integrators) in order to obtain autocorrelation or cross-correlation of messages after they have been translated into voltages. A commutator or a ring counter is employed to provide the switching pulse.

"The spectrum of the output of a half-wave rectifier is derived for an input which is the sum of random noise and two sinusoidal signals of different frequencies. The method used is the characteristic function method described by Rice. The components of the output spectrum are given as infinite series of hypergeometric functions. If both the input signals .are small compared with the noise, it is shown that the ratio of the output signal power at the difference frequency to the output noise power is proportional to the product of the input signal-to-noise power ratios at the two frequencies. If one of the input signals is very large compared with the noise, it is shown that the other signal and the noise are translated in frequency without alteration of the signal-to-noise ratio. A correction factor is obtained for the case where the large signal is not quite large enough. Finally, the output signal-to-noise ratio of a single-sideband detector is calculated as a function of the input signal-to-noise ratio, when the sideband amplitude is one-half the carrier amplitude.",['L.

"We investigate several conceptions of linguistic structure to determine whether or not they can provide simple and ""revealing"" grammars that generate all of the sentences of English and only these. We find that no finite-state Markov process that produces symbols with transition from state to state can serve as an English grammar. Furthermore, the particular subclass of such processes that produce n -order statistical approximations to English do not come closer, with increasing n , to matching the output of an English grammar. We formalize-the notions of ""phrase structure"" and show that this gives us a method for describing language which is essentially more powerful, though still representable as a rather elementary type of finite-state process. Nevertheless, it is successful only when limited to a small subset of simple sentences. We study the formal properties of a set of grammatical transformations that carry sentences with phrase structure into new sentences with derived phrase structure, showing that transformational grammars are processes of the same elementary type as phrase-structure grammars; that the grammar of English is materially simplified if phrase structure description is limited to a kernel of simple sentences from which all other sentences are constructed by repeated transformations; and that this view of linguistic structure gives a certain insight into the use and understanding of language.",['Noam Chomsky'],393,,Three models for the description of language,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,1956,6068418b-4c47-42b0-b3bf-1b854549dc9b
"Solutions are obtained in open form for the optimum, probability-computing detector of either Gaussian signals, or known signals transmitted via scatter-paths, where the signals have been further perturbed by additive white Gaussian noise. The optimum receiver operates on the received waveforms with filter-functions and biasing constants determined by pairs of inhomogeneous and homogeneous integral equations, respectively. General solution in closed form has not been obtained, but it is possible to draw a few broad conclusions, among them that the filter-functions can be physically realizable. Approximate solution (for the optimum scatter-path receiver) at small signal-to-noise ratios yields a block diagram having interesting implications. For a single-scatter-path, the optimum receiver may be interpreted as the combination of a correlator with an optimum estimator of the Wiener type.

"The theory of least mean-squared-error filtering and prediction of statistical time series, developed by Kolmogorov,1 Wiener,2 Bode and Shannon,3 and others,4 has recently found applications in a variety of control systems. The design of optimum (least mean squared-error) predictors is based on measurement or calculation of power spectra. The present paper describes equipment for measuring power spectra at very low frequencies. It is shown that analog circuits having the transfer functions of exact stagger-tuned triples, with flat response in the pass band and good skirt selectivity, are easily designed and utilized in conjunction with magnetic tape recordings. Although the optimum predictor transfer function can be computed directly from the power spectrum of the signal to be predicted, the computation is complicated and a checking procedure is desirable. An analog computation which permits such a check is described. Since the power spectrum defines the optimum predictor, it determines the mean-squared prediction error as well. However, if a nonoptimum network is arbitrarily selected for use as a predictor, it becomes desirable to determine the incremental error that results from use of this network. A simple analog computation which determines the error of the optimum predictor and the incremental error of a nonoptimum predictor is described. This analog technique is a specific adaptation to prediction of the impulsive response techniques of Bennett5 and Laning and Battin.","['Martin R. Bates', 'D. H. Bock', 'F. D.

"A frequency error analysis of computing elements is presented which leads to a definition of their dynamic accuracy. The concept of a computing transfer function is introduced for this purpose, permitting the evaluation of an effective bandwidth, the latter being connected with the variance of the output for wideband inputs. Limited bandwidth is considered as equivalent to finite resolution and thus to an additional effective error. Single frequency errors are dealt with separately and are shown to be of minor importance. Suitable optimalization of dynamic accuracy yields parameters of design and performance such as optimum computing time and required base amplifier gain. The theory is applied to integrators and adders with base amplifiers of direct and of capacitive coupling.",['Amos Nathan'],1,[],Dynamic Accuracy as a Design Criterion of Linear Electronic-Analog Differential Analyzers,Ire Transactions on Electronic Computers,1957,5b213fb7-3577-482f-9b95-4d84c750b638
"An important characteristic of coherent integrators is that their effective bandwidth decreases as the integration time increases. If it is only known that a weak signal occurs somewhere in a given frequency range, then the number of integration channels required to cover the specified range increases as the amount of coherent integration is increased. However, each integration channel can independently cause a false alarm, although only the particular channel in which the signal appears can cause a true alarm. The question arises therefore whether it is profitable to lengthen the coherent integration period to increase the signal-to-noise ratio when doing so requires an increase in the number of integration channels. This problem is investigated analytically. Numerical results appropriate for system design are presented as a series of graphs of missed-signal probability vs number of integration channels, with initial signal-to-noise ratio and over-all false alarm probability as parameters. Also included is a detailed analysis of statistical properties of ideal and approximate ideal coherent integrators.","['Kenneth S. Miller', 'R.

"In this paper we wish to show that the fundamental problem of determining the utility of a communication channel in conveying information can be interpreted as a problem within the framework of multistage decision processes of stochastic type, and as such may be treated by means of the theory of dynamic programming. We shall begin by formulating some aspects of the general problem in terms of multistage decision processes, with brief descriptions of stochastic allocation processes and learning processes. Following this, as a simple example of the applicability of the techniques of dynamic programming, we shall discuss in detail a problem posed recently by Kelly. In this paper, it is shown by Kelly that under certain conditions, the rate of transmission, as defined by Shannon, can be obtained from a certain multistage decision process with an economic criterion.

It is assumed that the input function consists of a nonrandom polynomial plus stationary uncorrelated noise.

"Given a set of equally spaced measurements, it is possible to curve fit a ""least squares"" polynomial to the N observed data points and obtain estimates of the past, present, or future values of the data or its derivatives by appropriate manipulations of the curve fit. This curve fitting can be accomplished by a linear weighting of the observed data over an interval (n-1) T . If the data is measured in real time such that a new data point is observed each T seconds, then the desired output (for example, the smooth or predicted value of the data) can be obtained by sliding these fixed number of weights such that the same weight always multiplies the data which is at a fixed lag with respect to the most recent data. Since these weights are zero for lags greater than n , they may be described as a fix-finite memory linear digital filter. In calculating the desired output for each new sample one requires a machine which can store n coefficients, n data points and performs n multiplications and n - 1 additions in at least T seconds. The coefficients do not change but the multiplications and additions must be performed each T seconds as a new data point is measured. For large values of n , and small T , this may put a severe requirement on the real time solutions of the computer. This paper presents an alternate technique using recursion formulas to obtaining the same results as the n point weighting equation. The method has the advantage of requiring considerably less storage, multiplications and additions when n \gg 1 and the degree of the curve fitting polynomial (K) is small.",['Marvin Blum'],50,['f67a5562-17ec-4273-8d1a-10d661a3b68b'],Fixed memory least squares filters using recursion methods,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,1957,67ece98f-1b02-45c9-a5dd-b9339991abea

"This paper treats the detection of pulsed signals in the presence of receiver noise for the case of randomly fluctuating signal strength. The system considered consists of a predetection stage, a square law envelope detector, and a linear postdetection integrator. The main problem is the calculation of the probability density function of the output of the postdetection integrator. The analysis is carried out for a large family of probability density functions of the signal fluctuations and for very general types of correlation properties of the signal fluctuations. The effects of nonuniform beam shape and of nonuniform weighting of pulses by the postdetection integrator are also taken into account. The function which is actually evaluated is the Laplace transform of the probability density function of the integrator output. In many of the cases treated, the resulting Laplace transform has an inverse of known form. In such cases the evaluation of the probability density function would require the computation of a finite number of constants; in practice this would usually require the use of computing machinery, but would be perfectly feasible with presently available computing machinery.",['Peter Swerling'],12,[],Detection of fluctuating pulsed signals in the presence of noise,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,1957,b84fdb4b-649d-456c-8c0a-4e9b01ebee87

"The convenience of vector notation in formulating physical geometrical problems results principally because the significance of the problem can be isolated from the analysis used in its solution. When analog computer techniques are employed in problems of this nature, the advantages of the vector methods frequently are lost because the computer inherently is more adaptable to solving problems described in the algebraic field of real numbers rather than in a vector space, and vector equations must be reduced to their scalar counterparts before a network for solving the equations may be synthesized. To facilitate treatment of problems of this type, a method is presented for synthesizing networks directly from the vector notation. This method will simplify synthesis and analysis of the networks by drawing a closer analogy between the mathematics and the electronics. The application of transformations and operators represents two areas in which the pertinent aspects of the method can be illustrated. This is accomplished by presenting first the basic mathematical background, followed by the network aspects of the problem, and finally, by the illustrative examples.

"The basic requirement for stability of a direct-coupled transistor logic (dctl) circuit is that a voltage margin exist between the maximum collect-emitter voltage of an ``on'' unit in the system environment and the minimum base-emitter voltage required for a transistor to be sufficiently ``off.'' This margin has been expressed in terms of the fundamental device parameters: commonbase forward and inverse current ?N and ?I; ohmic body resistances of the emitter, collector, and base regions, ?e? and ?c? ?bIII; collector saturation current, Ico; and the ratio of the value of ? in the vicinity of the ``off'' state to its value in the vicinity of the ``on'' state. In addition, the connection of bases in parallel results in a dependence of stability on the magnitude of?I and of ?bIII and on the variations of ?N, ?I, ?bIII and ICO among units connected in this manner. Circuit stability requirements have been expressed in terms of these parameters and the effect of their variations is considered. Methods for the specification of acceptance requirements for dctl transistors and the relation of these specifications to logic design rules are discussed.",['James W.

"Polynomial equations occur quite often in physical and mathematical problems and require an exact solution. Several problems in control engineering, aerodynamics, and many other fields require the formulation and exact solution of algebraic equations of quite a high order. In the past, several mechanical and electrical machines for the determination of the roots of polynomials have been developed, but all of them suffer from the serious disadvantage that they are very expensive and are incapable of high accuracy and rapidity of operation. This paper describes the development, design, and construction of an inexpensive and portable isograph which is capable of locating the roots of a polynomial with fairly high accuracy. This isograph can serve as a valuable aid to large-scale computing machinery, for which the roots of a polynomial must be isolated before further calculations can be performed. It can also serve as a very useful adjunct to other mathematical processes such as complementary solution of differential equations, determination of latent roots of a matrix, and similar other applications. It is hoped that this inexpensive and portable instrument will prove extremely useful in the design of servosystems and in other fields where the problem may be presented as a polynomial and that theoretical studies of engineering problems will be greatly augmented by its use.",['P.

"Thermistors which are thermally-sensitive resistors having large negative temperature coefficients of resistance can be aptly used for the gradual application of heater voltage to thermionic tubes, thereby diminishing thermal transients and reducing mechanical failures. Full voltage is first applied to the thermistor and load in series and after temperature equilibrium is reached, the thermistors are shorted out. From a cold start thermistor resistance decreases by a factor of approximately 100 and heater resistance increases by a factor of 5 to 10. By selecting a set of series-connected thermistors to limit the current to a maximum of 120 per cent of the operating value during the voltage application, the initial voltage on the heaters will be less than 5 per cent of rated, and the voltage before shorting out, about 75 per cent of rated. Peak currents occur twice, once while the thermistors are in the circuit and again when the thermistors are shorted out at 90 seconds. One set of thermistors can be used to limit the current satisfactorily over a wide range of loads. The most favorable number of thermistors to connect in series is determined experimentally. Commercially available units in washer form can accommodate heater loads up to 1100 watts.","['J. J. Gano', 'G. F.

A bilateral switching network is one which contains only elements having the same switching transmission characteristic in both directions. Following the definitions for the terminology and notation, where some new terms are introduced, the definitions for a series-parallel network, a bridge element, and a bridge network are given. A condition, called the bridge condition, to test a given transmission function for possible bridge network realizations is presented. A stepwise decomposition procedure is developed which may be used for the analysis and synthesis of the series and parallel parts of the network. The steps are described both with linear graphs and connection matrices. The bridge condition partially formalizes bridge network synthesis. Redundant variables also are considered as an aid to network synthesis. Under certain conditions, the synthesis yields network realizations with the fewest possible number of elements.",['Raymond E.

"A loss of signal detectability results from ideal symmetric limiting of a very narrow-band signal in narrow-band Gaussian noise. At small input snr this loss can be expressed in terms of the degradation of the effective signal energy-to-noise power per cycle ratio. Proceeding from results derived previously by Davenport and Price, an expression is derived for this degradation in terms of the autocorrelation function of the input noise. The degradation is evaluated for three typical input noise autocorrelation functions and is found to be quite small in all these cases. It is seen that the degradation can be made to vanish by appropriately shaping the spectrum of the input noise. Regulation of the input noise spectrum to obtain conditions of limiter operation assumed in this paper may often prove to be a convenient method for reducing loss of signal detectability in band-pass limiters.","['R.

"A new method for the logical design of magnetic core pulse-switching circuits is presented. This method has features which make it excellent for use in standard packages. These features are the absence of spurious noise signals at the output; the fact that outputs are independent of the order of arrival of input pulses; the fact that interchanging components does not affect circuit behavior; and the fact that moderate changes in clock pulse amplitude and duration do not cause false operation. Furthermore, the number of components required by this system compares favorably with the numbers required by other systems. A computing system can be built by properly interconnecting a few different types of such packages. The new system uses advance current drive but performs the logical operations with both forward and backward windings in an output network. The use of both types of windings permits a reduction in the total number of cores required. Tests performed on actual circuits yielded very encouraging results. The circuits operated as predicted, and the performance was most satisfactory.",['Jack L.

When a character printed in magnetic ink passes beneath a magnetic reading head it generates a waveform. A method is described here to determine this waveform from the geometry of the printed character. The character shape is divided into elementary vertical units and the height of these units is then tabulated. A single set of experimental data is obtained in the laboratory by passing a magnetically printed bar beneath the same reading head which will be used to read the characters. Formulas are derived in this paper for combining the geometrical data obtained from the character with the experimental data obtained from the laboratory run with the head. A method is then described for programing a high-speed digital computer to derive the waveforms. The discussion explains why these waveforms are often superior to what might be obtained in an actual laboratory run of the printed characters.,"['Ivan Flores', 'Frank L.

"This paper consists of two parts. Part I, by Giguere and Jamison, discusses transistor circuits capable of regenerating 6.25-m?sec pulses at a 160-mc bit rate. Part II, by Noll, discusses techniques for multiplexing 16 digital signals with a 10-mc clock rate into a single signal with a 160-mc clock rate. Two methods of performing the regeneration function are presented. One method consists of dc level restoration for recognition of the signal and constant current coincident circuitry for the reconstruction of the pulses. The second method consists of operating on changes in the signal for pulse recognition and the use of a bistable circuit for pulse reconstruction. Timing in the second case is obtained by a constant current coincidence gate. Parallel-to-serial multiplexing techniques have been developed to combine sixteen parallel 10-mc clock-rate signals into a 160-mc clock-rate pulse train. The sixteen synchronous signals are applied to sixteen AND gates along with a 10-mc narrow gate pulse. The space separations of the resulting regenerated and timed AND gate output pulses is converted to time separation with only a small amount of signal loss. This is done by injecting the pulses at sixteen equally separated points on a broad-band delay line. Methods have been developed to reduce spurious responses resulting from multiple reflections on the delay line. The current mode transistor AND gates are suitable for AND/OR functions for individual 4-m?sec logic. The multiplexer may also be used as a piece of test equipment to generate repetitive 16-bit binary.","['W. J. Giguere', 'J. Jamison', 'J.

"Thin films of Ni-Fe alloy may be prepared to be anisotropic and exhibit square-loop M-H characteristics. In films that are single-domained with flux changes involving only rotation of intrinsic magnetization controlled by cross-magnetization fields, very fast switching action can be obtained for storage and logic functions. Problems of coupling to the flux changes and interaction in an array of such films require study of the magnetic-field distribution. In the treatment given, a circular, single-domain, thin film is represented by a very flat oblate spheroid. The field distribution outside the spheroid is found by assuming that the magnetic properties are characterized by an intrinsic magnetization M constant in magnitude, but varies in direction depending on field and energy considerations. Calculation of the field distribution is given for a typical film with diameter to thickness ratio of 105. From the regions over which field changes are most significant, conclusions are drawn as to the proper size of sensing loops and spacing to avoid interaction during switching in film arrays.","['Hsu Chang', 'A.G.

Enough work has been done to verify the fact that a computer can be programmed so that it will learn to play a better game of checkers than can be played by the person who wrote the program. Further-more, it can learn to do this in a remarkably short period of time (8 or 10 hours of machine-playing time) when given only the rules of the game, a sense of direction, and a redundant and incomplete list of parameters which are thought to have something to do with the game, but whose correct signs and relative weights are unknown and unspecified.

"The improvement of reliability and availability through redundancy of entire machines rather than of components is investigated. An attempt is made to break down the cost of operating a digital computer, and to determine the relationship between cost and system failure. Three specific cases are discussed. Case 1: Where n machines are operated independently, processing the same input data. The output is taken from a single one of them; if this machine fails, the output is promptly switched to a machine which is operating properly. As soon as repairs can be completed, the machine which had failed is returned to operation. System failure occurs only when all n machines are in the failed condition at the same time. A penalty cost is assessed for system failure, this cost being proportional to the system down-time. Case 2: Where n machines are operated as in Case 1, except that any machines which fail are not returned to operation until the beginning of the next operating period. Penalty cost for system failure is assessed in the same way as in Case 1. Case 3: Where n machines are operated as in Case 2, but where the penalty cost for system failure is a fixed amount and is independent of the resulting down-time.","['Donald E. Rosenheim', 'Robert B.

An electronic voltage encoder has been developed which converts analog voltages to their corresponding parallel seven binary-digit representations at a 50-kc encoding rate. The encoder is capable of being time-shared by any number of 0-50-volt range inputs. Performance tests indicate that the present design may be capable of eight binary-digit conversions at encoding rates as high as 80 kc.

"The ability of the Parametric Phase-Locked Oscillator (PLO) to detect, amplify, and store binary digital signals, in the form of two distinct phases of a carrier, makes it possible to use the device as the sole component in a digital computer system. The variable-capacitance version of the device operates readily at kilomegacycle frequencies, thus forming the basis of a digital computer at a kilomegapulse clock rate. In the present paper the results of an investigation of the behavior and possible applications of the variable-capacitance PLO are presented. The investigation was supported by experimental work with lumped-component variable-capacitance PLO's at 5 mc, and microwave variable-capacitance PLO's at 4 kmc. The steady-state behavior of the device is described; variations of the output voltage with pump voltage, loading, tuning and frequency variations are presented in the form of characteristic curves. Results indicate that the device is rather insensitive to reasonable changes in operating conditions and parameter values. The transient behavior of the PLO shows that the device can be switched in a number of different ways. Five such modes of operation are discussed; these are phase initiation, forced switching, burst generation, tri-stable operation and unconditional switching. Each of these modes has particular advantages for various applications. Switching times of the order of 3 to 10 cycles of the signal frequency are readily obtainable. The various modes of operation of the device suggest a number of applications both in logic and in memory.","['Lubomyr S. Onyshkevych', 'Walter F. Kosonocky', 'Arthur W.

"The usefulness of large-capacity digital differential analyzers (DDA's) is severely hampered by the complexity of the scaling process. The scales needed for programming a DDA have to be compatible with the so-called ``equilibrium,'' ``topological,'' and ``boundary'' constraints, imposed by the construction of the analyzer and the nature of the problem at hand. Simultaneous trial-and-error satisfaction of all these constraints, to achieve optimal range and accuracy of computation, is practically impossible for any problem involving more than a few integrators. The paper shows how the scaling constraints can be organized in a matrix form, and how optimal scales can be produced in a systematic manner.

The modification for integral numbers is essentially the addition of an even parity check bit to the Gray code representation. This facilitates both the arithmetic operations and the detection of errors?in the arithmetic process as well as in transmission. An adder using this code requires circuitry which is more complex than that of a conventional binary adder by a factor of about two or three.

"This paper describes a new algebraic way of determining irredundant forms from the prime implicants. The method does not require using the developed normal form, and it makes novel application of Quine's technique of iterative consensus-taking. Thus, by applying repeatedly the rule of consensus to the prime implicants, it is possible to derive alist of implication relations that express the necessary and sufficient conditions of eliminability of the prime implicants in terms of which the irredundant normal forms can be computed. The extension of Quine's technique to this phase of simplification serves to shorten considerably the logical machinery needed for complete solution of the simplification problem. By the same token, it renders the method suitable for use with a digital computer.",['Thomas H.

"According to the model discussed in this paper, a pattern recognizer is said to consist of two parts: a receptor, which generates a set of measurements of the physical sample to be recognized, and a categorizer, which assigns each set of measurements to one of a finite number of categories. The rule of operation of the categorizer is called the ``recognition function.'' The optimization of the recognition function is discussed, and the form of the optimal function is derived. In practice, a prohibitively large sample is required to provide a basis for estimating the optimal recognition function. If, however, certain assumptions about the probability distributions of the measurements are warranted, recognition functions that are asymptotically optimal may be obtained readily. A small numerical example, involving the recognition of the hand-printed characters A, B, and C is solved by means of the techiques described. The recognition accuracy is found to be 95 per cent.","['Thomas Marill', 'David M.

"When messages are transmitted as blocks of binary digits, means of locating the beginnings of blocks are provided to keep the receiver in synchronism with the transmitter. Ordinarily, one uses a special synchronizing symbol (which is really a third kind of digit, neither 0 nor 1) for this purpose. The Morse code letter space and the teletype start and stop pulses are examples. If a special synchronizing digit is not available, its function may be served by a short sequence of binary digits P which is placed as a prefix to each block. The other digits must then be constrained to keep the sequence P from appearing within a block. If blocks of N digits (including the prefix P ) are used, the prefix should be chosen to make large the number G(N) of different blocks which satisfy the constraints. Lengthening the prefix decreases the number of ""message digits"" which remain in the block but also relaxes the constraints. Thus, for each N , there corresponds some optimum length of prefix. For each prefix P , a generating function, a recurrence formula, and an asymptotic formula for large N are found for G(N) . Tables of G(N) are given for all prefixes of four digits or fewer. Among all prefixes P of a given length A , the one for which G(N) has the most rapid growth is P = 11 \cdots 1 . However, for this choice of P , the table of values of G(N) starts with small values; 11 \cdots 1 does not become the best A -digit prefix until N is very large. At these values of N , the (A + 1) - digit prefix 11 \cdots 10 is still better. The tables suggest that, for any N , a best prefix can always be found in the form 11 \cdots 10 , for suitable A . Taking P = 11 \cdots 10 and A = [\log_2 (N \log_2 e)] it is shown that G(N) is roughly 0.35N^{-1} X2^N . This result is near optimal since no choice of P can make G(N) exceed N^{-1}2^N .",['Edgar N.

"A twistor is an anisotropic ferromagnetic cylindrical wire with nonmagnetic core. The intrinsic magnetization flux curls in helical sense in the wire and has an air return path.

The interactions, although undesirable in packing bits in a memory array, can be used to advantage as operating forces in logical devices.1 This paper analyzes the demagnetizing field in a twistor bit, based on the geometrical model of a confocal hollow prolate spheroid and the magnetic characterization of the material by B? = ?0(H+M) where M? is the intrinsic magnetization, constant in magnitude, but oriented by the external field.

Such situations are typical in communication over scatter-multipath channels (with or without a specular component). In the deterministic case, the receiver essentially crosscorrelates the received signal with the signal before the additive noise was introduced. When a random channel is present, however, this latter signal, i.e., the output of the random channel, is not known at the receiver, However, knowing the statistics of the channel and the noise, the receiver can make an estimate of it from the received signal on the hypothesis that a particular signal was transmitted.

"A matched filter communication system is described whose underlying principles are based on the Rake. The point-to-point synchronous teletype system employs complex lumped-parameter networks to generate and receive a pair of long-duration, broadband signals representing Mark and Space respectively. The receiver contains a pair of matched filters whose output is a narrow pulse when the matching waveform is applied. One advantage of the system, arising from the long duration of the signals, is an increase in energy per teletype baud when operating under a peak power limitation. Another is that multiple propagation paths due to ionospheric reflection are resolved by the broadband signals, resulting in the appearance of the multipath pattern at the output of the Mark or Space matched filter. Recombination of paths is achieved by means of a recirculating delay line tuned to the teletype baud rate in conjunction with parallel multiplier-integrators in the Mark and Space channels. The combination acts as a self-adjusting correlation detector for the multipath pattern.",['Steven M.

"The purpose of this paper is to show that two-level (no more than two gates in cascade) multiple-output switching networks composed of unilateral switching devices such as diodes can be simplified or minimized in much the same manner as single-output networks. This is accomplished by extending the notation and techniques used in the simplification of two-level single-output switching networks to multiple-output switching networks. A simple procedure for identifying multiple-output prime implicants is devised and, as a final result, an algorithm is presented which can be used to minimize the switching network corresponding, to a number (q) of given Boolean expressions of the same variables. This algorithm is based on the Quine rules but has been modified to take advantage of the so-called ``don't care'' conditions which occur because some inputs are forbidden or because some outputs are of no concern.

"Considerations leading to the adoption of diode-transistor NOR circuitry for a moderately fast data-processing system are outlined. The design of the basic circuit is treated in detail. Development of a unique set of compatible logic packages from the basic circuit is described. This set is unique in the sense that a single type of diode-transistor circuit is used to provide the great majority of logic and storage functions required in the system. This single circuit type, which functions as a NOR circuit, is embodied in two package types. One package provides a single gate with a fan-in of five. The other package provides two gates, each with a fan-in of two. The latter type may be externally connected to provide a set-reset flip-flop. Only two other package types are used.

"An analysis of the terminal characteristics of thin ferrite toroid cores under arbitrary drive and load conditions is presented. The analysis is founded only on the following two experimentally confirmed conditions: 1) the time required for a complete reversal of flux under unloaded conditions is inversely proportional to the magnitude of a step-driving field which is in excess of the critical field required to initiate flux change; 2) the open circuit voltage-time output waveforms caused by step driving currents are identical when normalized with respect to amplitude and time. The normalized output voltage waveform f?(x) is used to develop a terminal characteristic equation. It is shown that f?(x) may be obtained by using a nonideal step-input current. Utilizing a modified Gaussian equation to represent f?(x), equations are developed to allow the prediction of core response to arbitrary input waveforms, using 4 parameters easily obtained from voltage response vs NI step-drive plots, and f(x), which is the integral of the normalized expression for the open circuit voltage f?(x), and is proportional to the flux switched in the core. The equations are expanded to include a load circuit and to test the validity of the expressions developed.

Signed-digit representations limit carry-propagation to one position to the left during the operations of addition and subtraction in digital computers. Carry-propagation chains are eliminated by the use of redundant representations for the operands.

The addition time for signed-digit numbers of any length is equal to the addition time for two digits.

"We pursue in this paper some of the ideas discussed a year ago at the First Annual Symposium on Switching Theory and Logical Design. For a general discussion of threshold logic, and for definitions and motivations of the terms used below, the reader is referred to ""Single Stage Threshold Logic"" also published in this volume [13]. Also, a general survey of recent papers in the subject has been published elsewhere [14]. The main subject treated below is compound synthesis. The importance of such a study was shown last year: The family of functions of n arguments realizable in a single stage becomes a vanishing fraction of all switching functions of n arguments as n grows (for n = 7 the ratio is about 1028 1/2). We provide an algorithm for determining ""2-realizability"" -- reallzability with two threshold elements. The general approach produces a good solution in any case, but one guaranteed optimal only for 2-realizable functions. We use here a geometric terminology; this new language is also used in the second section, where ""higher"" necessary conditions for realizability are discussed.

"A logical design technique is developed for use with the particular module developed for this system. The detailed properties of this module, as well as the philosophy that led to its particular form, were covered in Part I of the paper. Briefly, the module forms the (inclusive) OR function of two input variables. This function can subsequently be transmitted to three receivers, each transfer being independently logically positive or negative. The read-outs are nondestructive and the transmitter module must be explicitly cleared before read-in is again possible. In view of the relatively small fan-in and fan-out for this module, and since only the OR function can be directly formed during any single transfer, complex logic functions must be formed slowly, a step at a time. This step-by-step generation of functions results in the need for more modules than might otherwise be required, but aside from that, the synthesis techniques are not particularly different from those of customary logical design. In particular, the design of an arithmetic unit designed for decimal addition, subtraction and multiplication is outlined.

"Abstract : One of the more challenging features of ALGOL 60 is the possibility of allowing the dimensions of both own and non-own arrays to be defined by variables which take on their values only dynamically, so that no fixed amount of storage in the computer can be reserved by the compiler at compilation time. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the realizability of this feature of the language by presenting a model of such an allocator. The basis of the approach used here is that of allowing the translator include in the coding it puts out copies of those of its own functions which must, because of the specification of the problem, be carried out at run time. The mechanism described in this paper is independent of the possible presence of recursive procedures in the program.

"This paper describes an IBM 7090 program for the design of single output combinational switching circuits for arbitrary sets of primitive logical elements. The only restriction on circuit configurations is that no feedback loops may occur. The procedure is an outgrowth of one given by Roth. The decomposition techniques are generalizations of those discussed by Ashenhurst. Given a function F (A, B, C), where A, B, and C are states of binary variables and F may have don't care combinations, a representation of the form F = G [alpha (A, B), B, C] is called decomposition of F. Any loop-free circuit can be described by a sequence of decompositions. Efficient procedures for the detection of decompositions are given in terms of a convenient normal form representation of switching functions. Simplifications obtained by considering only the subclass of so called vertex-functions are discussed. The program carries out a systematic search through the admissable sequences of decompositions, using a lexicographic ordering, designed so that the most promising sequences are investigated first.

"The card-changeable permanent-magnet-twistor memory is a large capacity (ca 105 bits) storage media for information that is infrequently changed. The information is stored in the form of small bar magnets bonded to a removable plastic card. The magnets, when magnetized, inhibit the switching of a section of twistor wire at a twistor-wire-solenoid crosspoint. For maximum information density the magnet shape and strength must be optimized with respect to the magnet's action on the inhibited crosspoint and the fringing action on neighboring crosspoints. The objective is a magnet with a small dipole moment, but with adequate inhibition of the twistor switching over a reasonable range of misposition. Suitable magnet shapes and a general discussion of the stray fields in a large array of magnets are given. For maximum capacity, the transmission characteristics of the twistor wire and the character of the access switch must be considered. Two novel structures of this memory permit increased information density and capacity. The feasibility of a random-access high-density memory submodule containing 360,000 bits in 0.7 foot3 with a cycle time of 5 ?sec has been demonstrated.","['W. A. Barrett', 'Floyd B.

"The algorithm described in this paper is the outcome of an endeavor to answer the following question: Is it possible to find procedures which would enable a computer to solve efficiently path-connection problems inherent in logical drawing, wiring diagramming, and optimal route finding? The results are highly encouraging. Within our framework, we are able to solve the following types of problems: 1) To find a path between two points so that it crosses the least number of existing paths. 2) To find a path between two points so that it avoids as much as possible preset obstacles such as edges. 3) To find a path between two points so that the path is optimal with respect to several properties; for example, a path which is not only one of those which cross the fewest number of existing paths, but, among these, is also one of the shortest. The minimal-distance solution has been programmed on an IBM 704 computer, and a number of illustrations are presented. The class of problems solvable by our algorithm is given in a theorem in Section III. A byproduct of this algorithm is a somewhat remote, but unexpected, relation to physical optics.

The length N of the letters must be given by N = (M^k - 1)/(M - 1) , where k is an integer. A balanced communication channel, for which all errors in a transmitted digit are equally likely, is defined and a physical model given. The probability of correct reception of the code letters and the rate with which they transmit information in a balanced channel are calculated. This involves deriving formulas for the numbers of code letters having various numbers of 0's.

"Coincident-current techniques, usually associated with parallel ferrite-core stores, may also be used for the operation of serio-parallel or purely serial memories. After outlining, in block diagram form, one possible physical realization of a serial system, the paper examines the conditions under which such a store is economically justified. The distinguishing feature of the system discussed is that coincidence is established in the memory matrix between two currents representing an address signal and a time signal, respectively. Studies of the characteristics and economics of serio-parallel devices are however not reported in detail. It is shown how the properties of the time-controlled serial store may lead to the adoption of a word-asynchronous design for serial digital computers. In such a machine, timing is not controlled or determined by limited store access.

"A method of monitoring the program execution in a digital computer on the basis of the flow diagram of the computing program has been devised. A comparatively low-cost equipment for monitoring a maximum of 64 boxes in a flow diagram has been constructed. The monitoring method is flexible and convenient in its application. It can be used in connection with relative or symbolic addresses, compilers, etc. The user must provide only a flow diagram drawn on translucent paper in a certain form and the information to correlate this diagram with the computing program. A subroutine modifies the computing program as needed for the monitoring purpose and restores it to its original form when the user so desires. The monitoring introduces only a very small increase in computing time, requiring for each call-up of a box in the flow diagram only a time amounting to that needed for two simple unconditional jumps. The monitor can be used to present during the computation a visual dynamic picture of the progress of the program and to register, on occurrence, the whereabouts of an interruption, thus facilitating the tracing of the error. The principle of the monitoring method and the subroutine program, and the essentials of the constructed monitor equipment, are described in detail.",['Frank F.

"A method is described for converting a boolean expression to a disjunctive normal equivalent (two level OR-AND circuit) which is minimal under some criterion presented in advance, as for example, the number of clauses or the number of literals (equivalently, the number of OR's or the number of OR's and AND's together). The method employs the integer linear programming algorithm developed by R. E. Gomory and takes advantage of a new technique for obtaining the required integer matrix. From a boolean function Phi A = |aij| is defined by setting aij = 1 if prime implicant j covers canonical term i and aij = 0 otherwise. Then, for example, minimization of the expression Sigma jxj, subject to restrictions Sigma jaijxj $\gg$ 1 and xj a non-negative integer, is equivalent to obtaining a normal form for Phi with a minimal number of clauses. In practice A can be advantageously reduced in size prior to the integer programming. This reduced matrix is obtainable fairly directly from an expression for Phi by a succession of simple operations. The method has been programmed for the IBM 704 and tested on several hundred problems. In speed and range of problems solvable, it compares favorably with minimization techniques presently in use.","['Alan Cobham', 'R. Fridshal', 'J.

"Two analog-to-digital sequential converters have been devised which combine in one tunnel-diode pair per bit the functions of an amplitude discriminator and memory. In addition, one of the two schemes utilizes each tunnel-diode pair as a delay network. The conversion duration of one of these six-bit converters, which employs germanium 2N559 transistors and gallium arsenide 1N651 tunnel diodes, has been set to 1 ?sec. Shorter conversion times are possible, but are not required in the present application of that converter as an integral part of an electronic high-speed signal processing system. The use of tunnel diodes presents a significant improvement in the art of converter design by virtue of circuit simplicity and performance.

"A method is described which permits the encoding of arbitrary geometric configurations so as to facilitate their analysis and manipulation by means of a digital computer. It is shown that one can determine through the use of relatively simple numerical techniques whether a given arbitrary plane curve is open or closed, whether it is singly or multiply connected, and what area it encloses. Further, one can cause a given figure to be expanded, contracted, elongated, or rotated by an arbitrary amount. It is shown that there are a number of ways of encoding arbitrary geometric curves to facilitate such manipulations, each having its own particular advantages and disadvantages. One method, the so-called rectangular-array type of encoding, is discussed in detail. In this method the slope function is quantized into a set of eight standard slopes.

"It is shown that the problem of determining whether or not a given switching function is realizable with a single threshold gate can be reduced directly to that of determining the value of a two-person, zero-sum game. If this value is $\gt$ 1/2, the function is realizable. If the value is $\geq$ 1/2, the function cannot be realized. In the case of realizability the solution of the game gives the set of weights which accomplishes the realization. The method works equally well with functions having ""don't care"" conditions. When a function is not realizable a threshold gate is, nevertheless, defined together with a ""zone of uncertainty."" This gate is such that for a given input, gamma, if the weighted sum is above this ""zone of uncertainty"" then F(gamma) = 1, within the zone F(gamma;) is uncertain, and below the zone F(gamma) = 0.

"A unique system of ferrite-core matrix switches and drivers has been developed for a low-cost magnetic-core memory. The memory uses coincident-current techniques and has a capacity of 10,000 characters with seven bits per character. A 20-?sec read-compute-write cycle features serial-by-character processing. Approximately 7 ?sec is computing time, and 13 ?sec is read-write time. The matrix switch requires only two sets of five drivers to select one out of 100 individual outputs. The drivers operate in an unusual three-out-of-five coding arrangement. A Set and Reset a driver, each using four transistors in parallel, are also required for the matrix switch. Two matrix switches provide the 200 X-Y half-select drives for a 100 × 100 seven-plane core array. At read time, two half-select current pulses of 250 ma to 300 ma are emitted with an effective 10 per cent to 90 per cent rise time of 0.3 ?sec. At write time, half-select current pulses with 1.2-?sec rise time are emitted on the same selected lines, but in the opposite direction. A new method of timing the drive current allows the read pulse to rise in 0.3 ?sec, even with a low-voltage power supply and an inductive load that would otherwise limit the rise time to 0.8 ?sec. All current-driving circuits use alloy junction transistors. The drive current is furnished from a 10 to 12 volt power supply, and temperature compensation of the drive currents is accomplished through control of power-supply voltage.

"A transistor amplifier with nonlinear tunnel-diode or backward-diode feedback is described for use as a resistor-coupled threshold logic circuit or general purpose switch. The tunnel-diode feedback serves to virtually eliminate saturation and prevent cutoff thus allowing the high gain-bandwidth products of epitaxial switching transistors to be utilized at all times during switching. Switching plus delay times as low as 2 nsec have been observed with a fan in and fan out of three. Ring oscillator experiments show that delays per stage from 2 to 5 nsec are easily obtained with logical gains of two or three. The input impedance of the network is 3 to 12 ohms leading to a very practical threshold network. The particular logic decision is determined only by the bias current. Tolerance calculations are presented that indicate component requirements will not be severe. The peak current is not a critical parameter and can easily vary 100 per cent. Due to the quantizing effect of the tunnel-diode feedback, circuits with fan ins and fan outs of three would operate satisfactorily under worst case conditions with 2 per cent resistors and mild restrictions on the transistor and diode parameters. By adding backward diodes in series with the input resistors the tolerance requirements can be relaxed to 10 per cent resistors and slight restrictions on the diodes or transistor parameters. By using backward diodes the fan in and fan out can be substantially increased with little loss in speed.","['William R. Smith', 'A. V.

"Sequential table look-up algorithms are proposed for the evaluation of ln x and exp x. Tables of pre-computed constants are utilized in transforming the argument into a range where the function may be approximated by a simpler polynomial. In the case of ln x, x is transformed so that it falls into a close neighborhood of 1; in the case of exp x, x is transformed to a close neighborhood of 0. These algorithms are particularly effective when mechanized so as to carry out the predetermined sequence of operations without waste manipulation. Such special purpose organization is reasonable within the variable structure part of UCLA's proposed Fixed-Plus-Variable structure computer, as the same equipment may be reorganized for use in other special purpose configurations at other times.

"A relatively fast procedure for assigning codes to the internal states of a sequential machine is described, which leads to a reasonably economical logical realization of the machine in many cases.

"Description and performance are given for two slightly different forms of an adaptive receiver that is used with binary signaling in a multichannel communication system. Each channel has a non-dispersive, nonfading propagation path and additive white gaussian noise that is independent of, and equal in intensity to, the other channel noises. Either phase-independent orthogonal signaling (such as FSK) or phase-reversal-comparison signaling is employed to convey to the receiver both the message and information about the path strengths and phases. The receiver measures the path parameters and applies the results to the detection processing as though they were perfectly accurate; it is shown that this procedure is a natural extension of non-adaptive reception. Results are given without derivation for the probability of binary decision error, which depends on the type of signaling, the ratio of the total noise-exclusive signaling energy received to the noise intensity, the number of channels, and the ratio of the effective measurement time to the binary signal duration. The distribution of the received signaling energy among the channels is immaterial. Graphs of error probability are presented for selected system parameters. A novel by-product of the study is an error-probability expression for non-adaptive multichannel reception of quite general binary signaling. Optimal adjustment of the adaptive receiver for fading-path situations is also considered, but corresponding error probabilities have not yet been derived.",['Robert E.

"The purpose of this paper is to discuss a method for the construction of a mathematical model of a large biological system. This method, based on Gibbs' free energy hypothesis, uses the format of mathematical programming, while the actual computation is accomplished by the method of steepest descent. The biological system chosen to exemplify the mathematical method was the respiratory function of the blood in the human lung. This method is based on the postulate that chemical mixtures tend toward a reaction equilibrium which minimizes the potential, or free energy, of the system. We may thus write down the classical Gibbs free energy function for each chemical species, and require that total free energy relative to some standard state be minimized under the conditions of the experiment. The solution of the equilibrium problem consists of a set of mole numbers which minimizes the free energy function, subject to equations for conservation of mass and nonnegativity. The analog computer solution of the respiration model was undertaken not only to give fast, sensitive tests of the mathematical model and its assumptions, but also to obtain a simulation of the time dependent system. Examples of the mechanization of the equations are presented in this paper, and also results are computed for the static equilibrium of a canonical model.",['Edward Charles DeLand'],50,[],Simulation of a Biological System on an Analog Computer,Ire Transactions on Electronic Computers,1962,9a821a79-1298-4db2-aa83-6f26fbe4f3cc

"In this paper we define a subclass of comma-free codes which has a property called path invariance. The main advantage of codes in this subclass lies in the ease of establishing the positions of the divisions between words. Certain path-invariant comma-free dictionaries using K symbols to form n-symbol words are developed and their properties are studied. The number of words in these dictionaries is determined to be L(K-L)^{[n/2]}K^{[(n-1)/2]} where L is a parameter which equals one when n \geq 4K/3 , and [x] denotes the integral part of x . That this is the maximum obtainable dictionary size is proved for a special case. The ability of these codes to correct registration (synchronization) errors when n consecutive symbols are available (as opposed to the 2n consecutive symbols required by general fixed-word-length comma-free codes) is demonstrated. A comparison of dictionary sizes is made for path-invariant comma-free codes, general fixed-word-length comma-free codes, and codes using one symbol as a comma. In the range K \leq 6 and n \leq 9 the path-invariant dictionaries are about \frac{1}{2} to \frac{3}{4} the size of the corresponding general comma-free dictionaries.

"An explicit expression is given for the weights of any group code. The exponential weight of a vector, an element of a finite field, is introduced. It is a primitive n^{th} root of unity raised to the weight of a vector. Using the general representation of group codes via polynomials, a formula is obtained for the exponential weight of a code word as a function of the parameters of the general representation. The coefficients of the formula are obtained using elementary multiplication on the cyclic group of the nth roots of unity. The formula is, in general, quite complicated and requires a computer for computation of its explicit form. However, for the new practical codes of a highly algebraic nature (Bose-Chaudhuri, Cyclic, Polynomial, Jump-Shift Register codes which are characterized by simple field parameters and polynomials), the formula emerges more pliable.

"This study is devoted to approximately determine the reception threshold position in large lncex frequency modulation, as reached by the use of a hypothetical (yet unknown) optimum demodulator. First, an interpretation of threshold phenomenon is given, in the case of a continuous modulation system with modulation gain (i.e., which trades minimum necessary power against bandwidth). After SHANNON, demodulation is then represented as a non-topological mapping in high-dimensional signal spaces. For a continuous modulation system, however, it is locally topological (in a neighbourhood of the signal point). One may thus share the noise after demodulation into ,""neighbourhood"" and ""error"" noise, whether the signal plus noise point remains or not in the locally topological neighbourhood of the signal point. The former is predominant above threshold, the latter below; threshold is defined by the equality of their powers. In the FM case, neighbourhood noise is already known, according to the conventional large signal theory. Error noise may be approximately computed after replacing the actual continuous modulating signal by a discontinuous one, in such a way that: a) the performance, as far as error noise is concerned, remains essentially unchanged; b) but the optimum demodulator is then explicitely known (optimum in the sense of maximum likelihood, in the presence of stationary white gaussian noise), and allows thus for the explicit computation of the extreme threshold position. For this purpose, the modulating signal is a) quantized (this is justified by the discontinuous nature of the error noise); b) sampled at the NYQUIST rate, each of the samples being held till the following occurs (this is justified with the help of basic principles of statistical communication theory). The modulated signal thus obtained with a L -levels quantization is (for large index, and a somewhat rough choice of L ) a (quasi-)orthogonal L -ary signal, for which explicit calculation of error noise is easy. Its results show that a large improvement beyond the threshold of limiter-discriminator type demodulators is possible, though not as large as sometimes written about frequencyfeedback demodulators. A physical interpretation of these results is them attempted, by the use of the concept of ""short term"" spectrum. Finally, a critical review of the frequency feedback type demodulators is given, and a novel type of demodulator is proposed, which is believed to more closely approach the theoretical limit than does the frequencyfeedback type.",['Gerard Battail'],0,[],Approximate determination of the extreme threshold position in frequency modulation (Abstr.),IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,1962,3d6b42d9-1e7f-4cf1-9dd2-864f818b1e94

"Efficient use of block codes to communicate over a telemetry channel is dependent upon the knowledge of the instants, in time, that one code waveform, or code word, ends and the succeeding waveform begins. This word synchronization is the subject of concern in this paper. Two basically different single-channel synchronization techniques are discussed. The first relies upon the identification of periodically transmitted prefixes, which unavoidably increase the redundancy of the code without increasing its synchronous reliability. The second method eliminates the need for prefixes entirely and relies instead upon certain properties of the code itself. Both these techniques are investigated more closely as applied to binary orthogonal codes. Asymptotic results are obtained which show that the number of received words necessary to obtain synchronization with a fixed prefix length increases in proportion to the size of the code when the prefix method is used. In contrast, the number of words which need to be observed for the prefix-free codes remains constant independent of the code length.

"A fundamental problem in the design of fast (4 to 6 ?sec) word oriented memories using S-1 core material is the realization of a sensing amplifier which has the multitude of required properties. The sense amplifier is usually required to provide stable gain for bipolarity signals, to introduce a negligible delay into the signal path, to avoid dc level shift, to recover within a short time following the enable (or inhibit) noise, to provide a stable discrimination level, etc. Although many sense amplifier designs have appeared in the literature, none, to the authors' knowledge, are eminently suitable for a 4- to 6-?sec memory under the condition of ``worst case input pattern''?a long sequence of unipolarity pulses interspaced with ``blasts'' of enable noise. The basic requirements for a sense amplifier suitable for a word oriented memory in conjunction with a required memory cycle are discussed. This newly developed sense amplifier and its operation and design are presented. Emphasis is placed on the evolution of the techniques and circuits presented, and several other approaches pursued during the design are also described. The authors also comment on possible future approaches to the sensing problem.","['Gerson H. Goldstick', 'Edmund F.

"Let M be an incompletely specified sequential machine and Q be the set of internal states of M. We derive certain properties for classes of subsets of Q with particular emphasis on certain classes of compatible sets of states, subsequently called C-classes for M. We then briefly describe state minimization algorithms using these properties. The following types of theorems are proved: From an arbitrary incomplete machine M a machine M* is constructed which is transition complete, i.e., has a transition defined for every state and every input. Given a special type of partition of Q we construct from M a machine M' whose states correspond to the members of the partition. Relations between the C-classes of M and M' are given, and in particular, sufficient conditions are given for which the state minimization problems for M and M' are equivalent. Through the use of a class of sets of states ""generated"" by a given set of states of M, and a restricted type of compatibility relation between sets of states, certain sets of compatible states are shown not to be elements of any minimum C-class for M. Conditions are given on compatible sets S and S' of Q, where S' S/supseteq$S, such that if S is an element of a C-class Sigma for M, then (Sigma- {S}) $\cup$ {S'} is a C-class for M. Using these results, which restrict the family of C-classes one needs to consider, algorithms are described for two state-minimization problems.","['J. C. Beatty', 'Raymond E.

"Visual discrimination experiments were conducted using unfamiliar displays generated by a digital computer. The displays contained two side-by-side fields with different statistical, topological or heuristic properties. Discrimination was defined as that spontaneous visual process which gives the immediate impression of two distinct fields. The condition for such discrimination was found to be based primarily on clusters or lines formed by proximate points of uniform brightness. A similar rule of connectivity with hue replacing brightness was obtained by using varicolored dots of equal subjective brightness.

"In spite of their great potential for bandwidth saving in long distance telephony, vocoders have not found wide-spread acceptance. Two major problems have retarded their application. First is their strong electrical accent. Second is the so-called ""pitch problem;"" namely, deducing the nature of the talker's vocal excitation from his speech waveform. The reliability of this deduction and measurement depends critically upon high input speech-to-noise ratio, particularly between 50 and 200 cps. In many communication situations, this requirement precludes satisfactory operation. This limitation can be removed by a new method known as ""voice excitations' which eliminates the necessity for a decision-making pitch detector. The principal advantage of voice excitation is its insensitivity to input signal-to-noise ratio and equalization. A voice-excited vocoder (VEV) with a 720 cps (250-970 eps) baseband and 17 spectrum channels low-passed to 25 cps each, covering the band 970-3700 cps, has been built and evaluated. The test shows an average PB-word intelligibility of 86%, compared to 92% for input speech of the same bandwidth, both with an 18 db signal-to-noise ratio. Quality tests indicate that listeners rate VEV speech ""as good as"" the input in about 90% of the test utterances. 0nly 19% of conventional vocoder utterances were so considered. The vocoder performed about equally well for each of the 12 speakers in the quality test. Voice-discrimination tests indicate that voice identity is well preserved. Crucial factors influencing the remade speech quality are the accuracy of spectral flattening and the impulse response of the analyzer low-pass filters. These results indicate that the principle of voice excitation provides the key to practical speech bandwidth reduction.","['Edward E. David', 'Manfred R. Schroeder', 'Benjamin F. Logan', 'A. J.

The number of pulse trains having a given realizable autocorrelation function is determined. An ""impulse-equivalent"" pulse train is defined as one that yields, as closely as is theoretically possible, the same autocorrelation function that a single pulse gives. It is shown that impulse-equivalent pulse sequences exist for all lengths; the number of classes of these sequences is exponentially related to their length.

"The relative advantages of analog and digital techniques in simulating complex, nonlinear systems in real-time are discussed.

Programs for function generation and for the solution of the aircraft roll equation are presented to illustrate the operation of the hybrid computer and the significant increase in the effective computing speed of the digital computer that results from the incorporation of peripheral analog elements. Further gains can be made by tailoring the order code and logic of the digital computer to the specific problem class of interest. The hypothesis is presented that a hybrid computer is technically feasible today that would be competitive with analog techniques on the basis of both cost and the ability to simulate natural aircraft frequencies in real-time.

"Formulas for the error probabilities of equicorrelated M -ary signals under optimum phase-coherent and phase-incoherent reception are derived in the form of previously untabulated single and double integrals. These integrals are amenable to computer evaluation for arbitrary M . Two modes of reception are considered. In the first, one of M equal energy equiprobable signals is known to be transmitted during a symbol interval of T seconds through a nonfading channel with additive white Gaussian noise. The receiver is assumed to be synchronized in time and frequency with the incoming signal, and reception is on a per-symbol basis. Furthermore, the cross-correlation coefficients between all the signals are equal. The probability of correct decision in both phase-coherent and phase-incoherent reception is derived exactly, as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio, the common cross-correlation coefficient, and the size of the signal set M . In the second mode of reception, the only difference is that a threshold is incorporated in the receiver. The probability of false detection and the probability of detection and correct decision are derived exactly for both phase-coherent and phase-incoherent reception as a function of the threshold level, the signal-to-noise ratio, the common cross-correlation coefficient, and the size of the signal set M .

"CO-modulation is a new type of modulation for the transmission of telegraphic signals. Its primary object is to increase the speed of transmission in a given bandwidth. The essential features of CO-modulation are: 1. The lower frequencies in the information signals are suppressed by means of a high-pass filter before modulation on a carrier. 2. Two channels are provided in the same frequency band by using two carrier-voltages differing 90^o in phase. 3. The frequency components which are lacking are regenerated at the receiving end by means of positive feedback, thereby using a feedback network which is adapted to the high-pass filter mentioned in 1. The spectrum in the neighbourhood of the carrier frequency does not contain frequency components arising from the information signals. So a pilot signal of carrier frequency can easily be transmitted for phase-reference, thus allowing coherent detection of the signals transmitted by orthogonal modulation. In the demodulated signals the lower frequencies are missing. It is possible, however, to regenerate the low-frequency components suppressed at the sending end, because the related time-constants are well-known and independent of the transmission path. If these complementary signals are derived at the output and added to the received signals, then the original pulse pattern can be reconstructed. This procedure involves positive feedback which, for telegraphic signals, can easily be made stable. The name CO-modulation stands for complementary orthogonal modulation, thereby indicating the complementary action of suppressing and regenerating frequency components at the sending and receiving end respectively, and the orthogonal modulation by which two channels are supplied in the same frequency band. CO-modulation may be applied to synchronous as well as asynchronous telegraphy. In an experimental system the bandwidth from 700 c/s to 3100 c/s of a normal carrier-telephone channel was used for transmission of 4000 bauds. This corresp0nds to a relative speed of transmission of 1.67 bauds/Hz, which is not far from the theoretical maximum of 2 bauds/Hz as given by the sampling theorem.","['F. de Jager', 'P. van Gerwen']",1,,Co-modulation--A new method for high-speed data transmission,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,1962,65b8f869-eb2d-4438-a0cd-7b0ebe515196

"A noiseless matrix switch is a selection switch in which, for a given set of inputs, one corresponding output (the selected output) is nonzero while all other outputs are zero; the switch is load-sharing with efficiency one if all nonzero inputs contribute to the selected output with the same sign.

Considerable design flexibility is thereby provided, with respect to the number of inputs, the types of input drivers, and the winding ratios. As an example, previous results (Chien) indicate that 20 inputs are required for a certain type of 16-output switch. The present re-results show that only 17 inputs are required.",['Peter G.

"This paper studies a class of switching networks which are constructed by cascading two-input, single-output completely flexible binary logical cells. It is assumed that each cell can be adjusted at will in order that any one of the sixteen possible switching functions of its two binary inputs may be obtained at its single output lead. An n-input cascaded network is composed of n-l, two-input, single output logical cells. The inputs to a typical cell Ai consist of a signal variable Xi and the output ai from the preceding cell Ai-1. For the end cell A1 the inputs are the signal variables X0 and X1. The output is derived from the terminal cell An-1. In view of the growing interest in the area of ``self-organizing'' or ``adaptive'' switching networks, the study of the type of network just discussed seems to be pertinent. The results presented here are pertinent to typical n-input cascaded structures, and consist of characterization and enumeration of the class of all n-place realizable switching functions, test procedure for the determination of the realizability of arbitrary n-place switching functions, and finally determination of all possible cascaded structures for synthesis of realizable n-place switching functions.

"A detailed study has been made of a certain class of systematic binary error-correcting codes that will correct the error bursts typical of some digital channels. These codes--generalizations of codes discovered by Abramson and Melas--are cyclic codes designed to correct any single burst of errors per n -digit word provided that the width of the burst (regarded cyclically) does not exceed a certain number of digits, b . Moreover, these codes are optimum in the sense that they employ the minimum number of redundant digits theoretically possible for a cyclic code with given values of n and b . A cyclic code is completely characterized by its generator polynomial g(x) , hence, the properties of the code can be determined by analysis of the corresponding g(x) . Necessary and sufficient conditions on g(x) have been formulated for the corresponding cyclic code to be an optimum burst- b correcting code. These conditions have been formulated into a series of tests that can be carried out (in principle) on any g(x) . All optimum burst- b cyclic codes with n  and b  have been found in this way and their generators are tabulated in the paper. In all, 98 codes are listed (not counting reciprocals) for b = 3 and b = 4 ; it was shown that no optimum codes exist for b = 5 within the limits stated.

"In the synthesis of switching circuits, a formal representation of the function to be realized by the circuit is first established and simplified as much as possible. Only then is construction of the circuit undertaken. It is argued that an analogous strategy should be followed in the synthesis of digital computer programs: the function to be realized by a program should first be established in a suitable formalism; the resulting formal expression should then be simplified as much as possible; only at this point should translation into the final ``machine'' program be undertaken. In the light of this discussion, the simplification of a certain type of elementary program, containing no branching or internal modification, is considered in detail. It is argued that the analysis of this type of program, whose formalization is called a ``computational chain,'' is a prerequisite to the analysis of more general programs.

"This paper examines the problem of synthesizing a switching function using only majority gates. It is assumed that the switching function is given in truth-table form where any ""don't care"" input combinations have simply been omitted from the table. First, a theorem is derived which indicates those complemented variables and constants which must be added as additional columns of the truth-table in order that the function be realizable with only majority gates. Likewise, the same theorem permits unnecessary input variables to be eliminated. Next, the table is ""unitized"" by complementing those rows where F is to be O. Finally, a reduction theorem often permits many of the rows of this ""unitized"" table to be eliminated. Various synthesis procedures are described based on this reduced table. Two ""canonical"" realizations are shown which follow immediately from the table. A more comprehensive procedure for three-input gates is then described. Extensions of the methods to majority gates with more than three inputs and to multiple-output functions are discussed briefly. Examples are included.",['Sheldon B.

"Three notions are introduced: 1) a class of logic nets with ``disjunctively linear structure,'' 2) ``disjunctively linear behavior'' or logic nets, and 3) ``position diagrams'' to represent logic nets. Through the study of their properties, it is shown that there is a close relationship between disjunctively linear structures and the behavior of logic nets. It is then shown that the state diagrams of Moore and Mealy and the regular expression of Kleene can be considered as particular manifestations of the notion of disjunctive linearity. By means of the notion of disjunctive linearity, a unified treatment is given to state diagrams by Mealy and the logic nets constructed by Copi, Elgot, and Wright from regular expressions. Finally, a discussion is given to the normal form and the position diagram providing a technique for describing disjunctively linear logic nets. Some problems, such as the practical application of disjunctively linear logic nets for hazard-free operation and the minimization of regular expressions through the use of position diagrams, are suggested.",['Hisao Yamada'],50,"['179fde33-8e59-4fd9-bb57-adf2cb41eb7b', '689e4177-751a-44a9-bda8-72a0b161cc4b', '70e19a57-78b6-4c5e-bce8-d1ceb1244bdf', '76d61e65-2f2d-426b-a9c2-6ccc48f6a1cd', 'd2fb92c8-e105-445f-b5b9-c017dcab9eee']",Disjunctively Linear Logic Nets,Ire Transactions on Electronic Computers,1962,bdb1e272-30ca-44c3-92f4-390585e4d698

"Abstract : A set of matrices is defined, and the complete solution of each matrix is given. The matrices have arbitrary dimension, and a large nuber of parameters. By adjusting these parameters, a matrix of arbitrary dimension can be constructed which has two eigenvectos tht are nearly coincident, which is derogatory (has fewer than the maximum possible number of eigenvectors), or is s nearly singular as desired. Thus a set of matrices is available which forms a convenient set of check matrices for testing computer programs which purport to solve or invert a matrix. The matrices of the set have certain properties of regularity. For selected values of the parameters, the matrices appear as variance-covariance matices in statistics. In particular cases, the eigenvalues (but not the eigenvectors) and the determinants were found. (Autho)",['J. L.

"This paper summarizes some rather extensive research on the problem of constructing logic nets out of elements whose timing causes trouble either in their slowness or in their lack of precision. The problem is made precise by setting up a theory of logic nets that is abstract but realistic. Its abstractness consists in its lack of similarity to any particular hardware, and in its strictly mathematical formulation, which leaves many engineering problems out of consideration. Its realism consists in its adherence to several stipulations: (S1) There is an upper bound on the fan-in and fan-out of any element. (S2) There is an upper bound on the number of elements that can occupy a given area or volume of space. (S3) There is an upper bound on the distance between two elements that are directly connected together. (S4) There is a lower bound, greater than zero, on the time of operation of any element. (S5) The timing of any element is not precisely predictable; all that is known about how long it will take to switch is an upper bound and a lower bound; beyond this knowledge, the timing is not even statistically predictable. There is theoretical justification in our having assumed, unrealistically that elements never malfunction or wear out. The theory affords a way of constructing, with a constant repetition rate, all finite automata as asynchronous nets that will withstand a worst-case analysis. Similar work by others is compared.",['Robert McNaughton'],3,[],Finite automata and badly timed elements,foundations of computer science,1963,a2cb2f04-3b38-42ae-8de8-4cbef7ca26fe

"In an earlier paper, ^{1} the design of filters by means of an iterative adjustment scheme was described. The filter was assumed to be of a fixed form but to contain k variable parameters. The problem is to find the parameter setting that minimizes the expectation of some weighted value of the error. The adjustment scheme was proposed because it has two advantages over present analytic techniques: 1) the error-weighting function may be any convex function rather than being restricted to the square: 2) the method does not require preliminary measurement of correlation functions or other statistics. The work presented in the previous paper was deficient in two respects: 1) it required that the adjustable parameters take on only quantized values rather than being continuously variable; 2) the rate of convergence presented there was slower than that actually obtainable. Section II of this paper presents the results of work that has eliminated both of these difficulties. Section III presents a scheme for continuously adjusting the filter parameters and proves that, under reasonable conditions, the parameter setting converges to the optimum. The advantage of this continuous-adjustment scheme over the one previously described is that it may be realized with only simple analog equipment.",['David J.

If the stochastic extremand is replaced by the truncated minimax-maximax preference functional the optimal dynamic path is shown to be a geodesic in Riemann space with the standard deviation of the objective function as metric. Surprisingly, the path is independent of the risk attitude adopted.",['Paul van Moeseke'],1,[],Dynamic risk programming with learning adjustment,Mathematical Methods of Operations Research,1963,f7b61403-0ab9-41b2-a049-99155794e620

"This paper discusses a class of final value problems where the criterion function and the set of admissible control variables are given by equation (1.1) of this paper. One feature which makes the maximization of the criterion function less straightforward is the presence of a time varying upper limit on the input to the linear plant, where the input to the plant is related to the control variable linearly. (In the paper they are related via an integrator.) Because the control variable enters linearly into the criterion function of equation (1.1), the criterion function can be transformed into such a form that an optimal control variable can be recognized as simply depending on signs of some auxiliary function as in equation (2.7) of the paper. Investigations of optimal policies would be simpler if the auxiliary function is independent of the control variable. Because of the special feature of the time-varying upper limit, the auxiliary function depends on the adopted control policy; hence there results the added complication in searching for an optimal policy. In the paper the assumption that h(T-t) is of the same sign is used in an essential way to obtain explicitly an optimal control policy. Some discussions on the uniqueness of such optimal control variables are also given in the paper. The approach in this paper is applicable in principle to optimization problems where the criterion function is factorable, J(z) = @?^1""0 h[z(t)]k(t)dtwhere h(z) is linear in z, and/or in its derivatives. One of the most significant pieces of information in optimal problems is the structural information of the control policy space, since such structural information can be used in answering questions on optimal and suboptimal policies on a wider basis, e.g., questions reflecting economic and engineering factors not originally included in the mathematical model. Some initial attempts in this direction have been made in this paper. As a final comment, in general optimization problems, judicious uses of some auxiliary functions in the investigation of optimal policies may be quite effective.",['Masanao Aoki'],50,[],Synthesis of optimal controllers for a class of maximization problems,Automatica,1963,ce9888df-4fff-4984-9cf9-99c48ccbe8ea

"In the type of recognition system under discussion, the physical sample to be recognized is first subjected to a battery of tests; on the basis of the test results, the sample is then assigned to one of a number of prespecified categories. The theory of how test results should be combined to yield an optimal assignment has been discussed in an earlier paper. Here, attention is focused on the tests themselves. At present, we usually measure the effectiveness of a set of tests empirically, i.e., by determining the percentage of correct recognitions made by some recognition device which uses these tests. In this paper, we discuss some of the theoretical problems encountered in trying to determine a more formal measure of the effectiveness of a set of tests; a measure which might be a practical substitute for the empirical evaluation. Specifically, the following question is considered: What constitutes an effective set of tests, and how is this effectiveness dependent on the correlations among, and the properties of, the individual tests in the set? Specific suggestions are considered for the case in which the test results are normally distributed, but arbitrarily correlated. The discussion is supported by the results of experiments dealing with automatic recognition of hand-printed characters.","['Thomas Marill', 'David M.

"A dynamic large signal model for a thin film inductor consisting of two orthogonal windings wound around a thin single-domain film is developed. Based on Gilbert's modification of the Landau-Lifshitz equation describing the rotational behavior of the magnetization of the film, this model is valid for both large and small signals and for frequencies up to several hundred megacycles. As a result of the gyroscopic nature of mangetic behavior, the model of necessity contains as a part of its description a nonlinear second order differential equation in time. Until the external circuits connected to the inductor are specified, one cannot explicitly relate magnetic behavior and terminal voltages and currents. Instead one must seek a simultaneous solution of the differential equations describing the interconnected system.

"1. Summary   In Part I, four ostensibly different theoretical models of induction are presented, in which the problem dealt with is the extrapolation of a very long sequence of symbols—presumably containing all of the information to be used in the induction. Almost all, if not all problems in induction can be put in this form.  Some strong heuristic arguments have been obtained for the equivalence of the last three models. One of these models is equivalent to a Bayes formulation, in which a priori probabilities are assigned to sequences of symbols on the basis of the lengths of inputs to a universal Turing machine that are required to produce the sequence of interest as output.  Though it seems likely, it is not certain whether the first of the four models is equivalent to the other three.  Few rigorous results are presented. Informal investigations are made of the properties of these models. There are discussions of their consistency and meaningfulness, of their degree of independence of the exact nature of the Turing machine used, and of the accuracy of their predictions in comparison to those of other induction methods.  In Part II these models are applied to the solution of three problems—prediction of the Bernoulli sequence, extrapolation of a certain kind of Markov chain, and the use of phrase structure grammars for induction.  Though some approximations are used, the first of these problems is treated most rigorously. The result is Laplace's rule of succession.  The solution to the second problem uses less certain approximations, but the properties of the solution that are discussed, are fairly independent of these approximations.  The third application, using phrase structure grammars, is least exact of the three. First a formal solution is presented. Though it appears to have certain deficiencies, it is hoped that presentation of this admittedly inadequate model will suggest acceptable improvements in it. This formal solution is then applied in an approximate way to the determination of the “optimum” phrase structure grammar for a given set of strings. The results that are obtained are plausible, but subject to the uncertainties of the approximation used.",['Ray J.

"The mean diameter of the human pupil was measured during stimulation of the eye with light of sinusoidally varying intensity and during stationary illumination with the corresponding average intensity. Continuous records of the pupil diameter were obtained using an electronic pupillometer. The light stimuli were electronically controlled by utilizing the Faraday effect and applied under “open loop” conditions. The pupil responded with a net contraction to modulation of the light intensity within a range of modulation frequencies up to 30 c/sec. The net contraction was maximal between 1 and 3 c/sec, but remained significant at high frequencies, which did not result in a periodic light reflex any more. The higher the modulation degree and the average intensity, the larger the net contraction. The dependence of the net contraction upon the modulation frequency is very similar to that of the subjective brightness (Brucke effect), although certain difficulties are encountered in attempting a direct comparison of the two phenomena.",['Varjú D'],7,[],Der Einfluß sinusförmiger Leuchtdichteänderungen auf die mittlere Pupillenweite und auf die subjektive Helligkeit.,Kybernetika,1964,7d76e12b-b680-49a9-b057-428bfdac47f9

It is assumed that the number of input conditions (n-vectors) which must produce each output state is given. It is clear that for each mapping of n-vectors into output status a different pair of output functions will be specified. The objective of this work is to find that pair of output functions which is independent of as many of the input variables as possible.

"A simple experiment on a magnetically-balanced circuit, consisting of a flux source and two equal-length parallel paths is outlined. It is observed that if a controlling signal causes one of the parallel paths to be preferred and this controlling signal is removed before switching is completed, the parallel path originally preferred continues to be preferred. The core equivalent of a balanced circuit is then examined to determine if this phenomenon is present there as well. It is found that the basic behavior of a balanced circuit and its core equivalent can be made the same, provided care is taken in setting up the same initial conditions in both circuits. It is shown that initial flux levels are important, as well as the rate at which these initial levels are established. An attempt is then made to relate, in a qualitative way, the circuit properties observed to known properties of a single core. It is observed that the properties which will be exploited here are present in most standard materials; however, a balanced circuit tends to exaggerate these properties. In Section II experiments on two balanced circuits interconnected with a 1:1 turns ratio coupling winding are described. This configuration has been found to have two stable states, the final state being dependent on the initial condition in one of the elements. Signal amplification has been achieved over at least a 4:1 range of drive currents.

"A model representative of any time-sampled, real-valued input and output digital system without feedback from system input to output (there may be internal feedback loops) is presented, and properties that are necessary for an optimum (nonlinear) digital system are developed.

"A new procedure is described for determining that frequency at which the spectrum of a signal has its absolute peak. The salient feature of the procedure is that it does not explicitly involve the estimation of the spectrum of the signal itself. Specifically, it is shown that the limit of the iterated normalized auto-correlation [see (8) and (9)] of a function, f(t) , is a pure cosine wave whose frequency corresponds to the location of the peak of the spectrum of f(t) . Furthermore, if one is willing to accept an estimated peak frequency of maximum energy to within a given finite spectral resolution, then the procedure terminates after a specified finite number of iterations. Results from a computer simulation of the procedure are described. The areas of application of this procedure are discussed, and the results indicate that this method of detecting a signal (i.e., by the peak of its spectrum) merits further consideration.

"This paper proposes a method, termed antiparallel control logic, for the control and efficient utilization of computer networks that exhibit substantial propagation delays on the lines interconnecting the logical elements, as well as in the elements themselves. The discussion encompasses the basic behavior of antiparallel stages that realize this method of control, including their logical realization and their extension to other useful network logic structures. In a strictly feedforward line, where the stored data are indexed forward by control pulses moving in a direction away from the data source, the existence of time variations in the delays of successive stages implies a nonzero probability that two successive control pulses will eventually appear at the inputs to a given stage so closely spaced that the basic reaction time of the stage is violated. The result is a failure of the transfer mechanism and a consequent loss of information. If feedback control is provided such that control pulses move in a direction opposite to the flow of information, that is, if the control and information flows are antiparallel, then the failure of the transfer mechanism does not cause an overlap in the information stored on the line, but rather leaves a void, or hole, which does not imply necessary information loss nor physically unrealizable storage requirements on the individual stages.","['Jack Goldberg', 'Robert A.

"The maximum improvement that can be expected from amplitude and/or phase adaptivity in the performance of an optimum receiver is evaluated in detail for a general class of broad- and narrow-band signals subject to slow Rayleigh fading in the ""on-off"" mode of operation. The pertinent Bayes risks are evaluated and compared for different states of a priori information. It is found that amplitude adaptivity yields an advantage increasing without bounds with the SNR, whereas phase adaptivity is a decreasing function of the SNR ratio. For the interesting region of moderately low error probabilities, and with equal a priori error risks, amplitude adaptivity yields an improvement in performance equivalent to 3-6 dB in SNR, whereas phase adaptivity yields an improvement of 2 or 1 dB depending on whether the amplitude also is known or not. The effect of asymmetry of a priori error risks is discussed. It is also pointed out that the optimum test for deciding on the presence or absence of the signal is uniformly most powerful with respect to the amplitude, so that no advantage can be expected from amplitude adaptivity in the Neyman-Pearson mode of operation.","['Raffaele Esposito', 'David Middleton', 'James A.

Vom Receptor zieht eine cuticulare Sehne (Receptorsehne) zum FemurTibia-Gelenk. Die wichtigsten Nervenverastelungen im Femur und eine anormale Lage des Chordotonalorganes werden beschrieben. -Das Chordotonalorgan ist Glied eines Regelkreises zur Stabilisierung des Femur-Tibia-Gelenkes. Dieser Regelkreis adaptiert, mindestens bei hoherer Belastung, langsam, aber vollstandig. —Wirkt bei einem senkrecht vom Korper abstehenden Bein eine Kraft in Richtung der Querachse auf das Tier ein, ist in der normalen Korperhaltung die Auslenkung des Tibia-Tarsus-Gelenkes fur kurze Zeit proportional zur einwirkenden Kraft. Die Regelkreise der beiden Korperseiten beeinflussen sich nicht gegenseitig. —Die von der Streckmuskulatur erzeugte Kraft ist um so groser, je starker der Receptor vor Beginn des Reizes gedehnt war. — Wird die Receptorsehne nach ausen gezogen, streckt das Tier das Femur-Tibia-Gelenk. Wird die Receptorsehne nach innen geschoben, beugt es das Femur-Tibia-Gelenk. Dabei ist ebenfalls vollstandige Adaptation zu beobachten. — Die Streckung der Tibia (in Winkelgraden) ist proportional dem Logarithmus der Bewegung der Receptorsehne nach ausen. Die Reaktion ist um so starker, je mehr der Receptor vor Beginn des Reizes gedehnt war. —Die Beugung der Tibia (in Winkelgraden) ist proportional dem Logarithmus der Bewegung der Receptorsehne nach innen. Auch diese Reaktion ist um so starker, je mehr der Receptor vor Beginn des Reizes gedehnt war. —Wird eine senkrechte Laufflache von der Seite beleuchtet, stellen sich die Tiere teils in eine Resultierende zwischen Licht-und Schwerkraftrichtung ein, teils wenden sie sich vom Licht ab. — Der Mittelwert der Winkel zwischen Tierlangsachse und Schwerelot (α1) ist bei den dem Licht zugekehrten Tierstellungen von der Lichtintensitat und dem Winkel zwischen Lichtrichtung und Schwerelot abhangig. Er ist unabhangig von Korpergewicht und Hangneigung. Die Streuung wird bei erhohtem Korpergewicht kleiner.

A number of features are provided to increase the speed of operation. There are three controls in largely concurrent operation. The control circuits are largely asynchronous and speed independent. The floating point arithmetic unit contains two adders and utilizes redundant number representation and separate carry storage. The memory hierarchy has members ranging from the 10-word, 0.2-μs. flow gating memory to magnetic tapes.

"Various devices for the improvement of phrase structure grammars (PSG) have been suggested recently. In particular, the PSG model with a pushdown store (PSG/PDS) as described by V. Yngve, and the PSG with subscripts (PSG/S) as described by G. Harman are considered. It is contended that such devices, even if they may do away with some of the difficulties of PSG, do not contain sufficient generative power to produce the structurally complicated sentences that are generated by other grammars (e.g., of transformational type). The handling of multiple disco, Ltinuous constituents (DC) in PSG/PDS, as well as the use of deletion rules in PSG/S is examined and criticized. It is shown that the improvements on PSG will not allow the grammar to generate all the sentences of the language that a transformational grammar (TG) does; moreover, the improvements on PSG are obtained only at the cost of introducing too much power at the PS level, so that the improved grammars in some cases will exceed the requirem@nts of the description, i.e. generate non grammatical sentences.",['Jacob Mey'],0,[],Pushdown stores and subscripts,international conference on computational linguistics,1965,fb45911f-276b-4205-99f0-bcf1f3cd5ccd

Binary partitions are introduced, and shift. registers are characterized in terms of binary partitions. An algorithm is given for the determination of the required partitions for a shift register assignment.

"In view of the main objective of designing more efficient electronic computers, logical designers, in recent years, have been much interested in realization of switching functions by networks of threshold gates instead of the classical ""AND"" and ""OR"" gates. Naturally, it is desirable to obtain a most economic network which consists of the least number of threshold gates. This gives rise to the problem of finding for a given switching function f a minimal decomposition of f with linearly separable component switching functions. Because of reliability considerations, the number of inputs to a threshold device cannot be too large, Thus, it is necessary to limit the number of variables of the component functions in the decompositions of f. This leads to the constrained minimization problem stated as follows: Let t denote a given small positive integer not less than 2. For an arbitrarily given switching function f, find a decomposition of f which consists of linearly separable component switching functions of not more than t variables. In this paper, an effective and mathematically rigorous finite process is presented for solving this problem. By the aid of a reduction theorem and the consideration of the total degree of repetition of a decomposition, the problem is solved by the iterated search for simple decompositions with respect to disjunctive or nondisjunctive partitions of the variables. Details and illustrative examples will appear in book form.","['Rodolfo Gonzalez', 'Eugene L.

"A servoanalysis of the feedback control system for lens accommodation has been based upon experimental evidence designed to explore the nonlinear properties. Because these nonlinearities are essential to the functioning of the system, a describing function approach was employed. Computation served to obtain open-loop characteristics.

The no-memory nonlinearity has general saturation characteristics; two related models, one with quite unusual aspects, are presented, and independent evidence for these adduced. The combined model accounts for large and small signal responses, stability characteristics, predicts certain noise spectral features of the openand closed-loop lens system. Phase discrepancies, possible sampled data properties, and the even-error-signal operator put forward crucial new experiments.","['Lawrence Stark', 'Yoshizo Takahashi', 'George Zames']",96,[],Nonlinear Servoanalysis of Human Lens Accommodation,IEEE Transactions on Systems Science and Cybernetics,1965,f0447f72-7eec-43f1-802b-1136a54caf7f

"This paper develops the separating capacities of families of nonlinear decision surfaces by a direct application of a theorem in classical combinatorial geometry. It is shown that a family of surfaces having d degrees of freedom has a natural separating capacity of 2d pattern vectors, thus extending and unifying results of Winder and others on the pattern-separating capacity of hyperplanes. Applying these ideas to the vertices of a binary n-cube yields bounds on the number of spherically, quadratically, and, in general, nonlinearly separable Boolean functions of n variables. It is shown that the set of all surfaces which separate a dichotomy of an infinite, random, separable set of pattern vectors can be characterized, on the average, by a subset of only 2d extreme pattern vectors. In addition, the problem of generalizing the classifications on a labeled set of pattern points to the classification of a new point is defined, and it is found that the probability of ambiguous generalization is large unless the number of training patterns exceeds the capacity of the set of separating surfaces.",['Thomas M.

"This paper deals with some of the problems encountered in a hybrid simulation of the motion of aerospace vehicles. These problems arise principally from the position of the analog-digital interface and the sampling, which of necessity occurs there, and introduces phase lags that can severely affect the validity of any simulation. The introduction of two redundant integrators can effectively decouple the rotational and translation loops. In this case, the high frequencies of the former can be represented in the continuous analog section, and the low frequencies of the latter can be represented in the discrete digital section. Sampling effects in loops involving digital function generation necessitate 75 to 100 samples per cycle if the damping of the simulated system is to be represented with any degree of faithfulness.","['E.

"The analysis of radar detection probability in the presence of unknown parameters, given by Kelly, Reed, and Root for maximum-likelihood detection procedures, is extended in this paper to cases where the detection procedures still belong to the class of maximum-likelihood procedures, but the actual waveform, or noise covariance, or both, may differ from those for which the detection procedure would be maximum likelihood. The analysis covers detection procedures ranging from fully coherent, through partially coherent, to pulse-to-pulse incoherent cases. These cases are distinguished by changing the list of parameters treated as unknown by the detection procedure. The resulting equations for the characteristic function of the detection test variable lead to probability distribution functions which are incomplete Toronto functions or generalizations of them; this is convenient for performance analysis, since these functions have been extensively studied. The analysis is further extended to the case of signals having fluctuating amplitudes and phases, for cases ranging from pulse-to-pulse fluctuations, through partially correlated fluctuations, to the case of complete correlation for the duration of the received waveform on a single scan. In the case of partially correlated fluctuations of amplitude and phase, the situation is considered where such fluctuations impose the limit on the amount of coherent integration which can be accomplished. The analysis is brought within the Kelly, Reed, Root framework by modifying the maximum-likelihood procedure to take account of a priori knowledge of the correlation properties of the signal amplitude and phase fluctuations, so that the resulting detection procedure becomes a maximum a posteriori procedure. A classification of special cases is given, with attention focused on the question of when it is still true (as in the case considered by Kelly, Reed, and Root) that the detection probability is given by an incomplete Toronto function, and when generalizations of these must be used. Also, a classification is given of the appropriate definition of signal-to-noise ratio for various special cases.",['Peter Swerling'],1,"['1d635ba9-98d4-4415-871a-eca0a91b689f', '58fe5b63-ad52-4532-9ee9-2909af29e8d1', 'b84fdb4b-649d-456c-8c0a-4e9b01ebee87']",Detection of radar echoes in noise revisited,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,1966,893ea30c-c46b-4f91-8c55-379b3f6d469d
"Computer simulation has been used for some time in the analysis and design of dynamic systems. With recent advancements in computer performance, the field of dynamic simulation---long the exclusive domain of the analog computer---has begun to utilize digital methods. No less than a score of digital simulation programs have appeared since R. G. Selfridge's pioneering effort in 1955; and the number is ever-increasing. These programs offer a convenient method of simulating continuous system dynamics employing well-known and easy-to-use analog computer programming techniques. The common starting point for such simulation is the conventional analog block diagram, and the common approach is the breakdown of the mathematical system model into its component parts or functional blocks. These blocks, having a near one-to-one correspondence with analog computing elements such as integrators, summers, limiters, etc., usually appear as subroutines within the simulator program. Using one of the simulation packages, ""programming"" involves no more than merely interconnecting the functional blocks by a sequence of connection statements according to the rules laid down by the input language. This interconnecting of blocks is analogous to the wiring of the patchboard on an analog computer. Therefore, these digital-analog simulation programs combine the best features of the analog and digital computers: the flexibility of block connection structure of the former and the accuracy and reliability of the latter.","['Wai Mun Syn', 'Robert N.

"The problem of analog communication over a randomly-time-varying channel is considered. An analog source generates a message which is assumed to be a sample function from a Gaussian random process. The message is passed through a linear realizable system before modulation. (This corresponds to the pre-emphasis network in FM.) The output of this system is the modulating signal for a no-memory modulator which, in general, will be nonlinear. The modulated signal is transmitted over a time-varying channel We restrict ourselves to Gaussian multiplicative channels. At the channel output, noise is added. The specific problem of interest is to find the optimum estimate of the message. The principle results are: \begin{enumeratge} \item An integral equation whose solution is the optimum estimate. \item A feedback demodulator whose output is the optimum estimate over a certain range of signal-to-noise ratios. \item A proof that the optimum demodulator corresponds to a joint channel and message estimator.

"This paper investigates 1) the problem of finding lower bounds on the computation times of on-line Turing machines, and 2) the trade-off relationship between computation time and tape dimensionality. It considers problems in which a Turing machine is supplied with a sequence of inputs representing data to be stored on the machine's tape(s), followed by a sequence of inputs requesting the machine to find and examine various portions of the stored data. The approach taken is to assume that the machine has been designed to read in and store data in such a way as to minimize the time required to subsequently locate arbitrary portions of that data. This approach sometimes makes it possible to find good lower bouds on the computation time (number of machine steps) needed to process the portion of the input sequence that calls for the retrieval of data. It is shown that there are some problems in which an increase in tape dimensionality appreciably reduces the computation time needed. But it is already known that increasing the number of a machine's tapes (beyond two) does not appreciably decrease the computation time needed. Thus, tape dimensionality and tape multiplicity are parameters that affect computation time in basically different ways.",['F. C.

"A device is proposed for providing an ultra high speed read, but comparatively slow write, memory device. The device has certain similarities to other proposed devices, but the mode of operation and performance is quite new and makes use of effects which are normally avoided or minimized in usual memory devices. The storage element is a thick-film bias magnet with a coercive force smaller than its self-demagnetizing field and is tightly coupled to a second anisotropic thick film which serves as the sensing or reading device. The array conductors are all external to the coupled structure (i.e., no conductors lie between the films) thereby simplifying fabrication. A modified coincident current technique is used to write the information into the bias film. A stored ``1'' is obtained by setting the bias film and hence the read film into a demagnetized state. A read current applied to the word line will cause rotation of the magnetic moments of the read film toward its hard axis, thus inducing a signal in the sense line. A stored ``0'' is obtained by saturating the bias film, which in turn saturates the read film in its hard direction and thus prevents any signal from being induced in the sense line during reading. The modes of operation and design parameters are presented as well as a number of measurements. The results thus far have shown that there are no fundamental barriers to overcome.",['Richard E.

"A multi-threshold element is one in which several thresholds are used to separate the true inputs from the false inputs. Many circuit elements and configurations can be described by this model. An approach, based on conventional single-threshold threshold elements, is developed for the analysis and synthesis of multithreshold threshold elements. It is shown that the basic properties of such elements are similar to conventional threshold elements, and that k-threshold threshold-element realizability of an arbitrary n-variable Boolean function can be related to conventional threshold-element realizability of a related (n+k-1)-variable Boolean function. Foundations for two basically different methods for the synthesis of a single-element realization of an arbitrary Boolean function are developed, as are procedures for transforming such a realization into both two-level and multilevel loop-free networks of k-threshold threshold elements k?1. Every element in the networks has the identical weight vector for the independent variables, which is some-times desirable. The transformation technique is a useful approach to the synthesis of functions by networks of conventional threshold elements. It is proved that if the given function requires a k-threshold threshold element, then at least [k/2+I] conventional threshold elements in a two-level network or [1+log 2  k] such elements in a multilevel network are required. Transformations are given for corresponding minimum-gate networks.

"Polarity Coincidence Array detectors (PCA) are considered for testing the hypothesis that a random signal is common to an array of receivers which contain noise processes that are independent representations of a given class of stochastic processes. A standard procedure is to reduce the received data by sampling and then hard limiting. Hard limiting is shown to introduce an inherent loss in input signal power of 1.96 dB when the input data is a sequence of independent samples from a stationary Gaussian process. However, when the stationary and/or Gaussian assumptions are violated, the relative efficiencies of the PCA detectors can greatly improve. When the input samples are dependent, it is necessary to assume Ganssian inputs in order to analyze the PCA detectors. However, these devices are still unaffected by a nonstationary noise level that is slowly varying relative to the inverse bandwidth of the pre-filter. Furthermore, the loss due to clipping is considerably reduced as the sample dependence (i.e., sampling rate) increases. For rapid sampling rates, the spectral shapes of the inputs must be known accurately in order to fix the false-alarm rate at some pre-assigned value.",['Morton Kanefsky'],10,['5218be88-c439-47cd-b7b4-387198ebb39f'],Detection of weak signals with polarity coincidence arrays,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,1966,600c93af-9946-4711-acd3-2059eab06aba

"The transmission of a nonbandlimited analog signal over a digital channel with a fixed bit-rate is considered. The trade-off between the mean-square error due to quantizing and the mean-square error due to the process of sampling and reconstructing the signal is investigated. Simple approximations to these errors, which are valid in most practical situations, are derived, and simple expressions are obtained from which the optimum sampling interval and number of bits per sample can be calculated. Results for first-, second-, and third-order Butterworth and fiat bandlimited spectra, together with the zero-order hold and the linear point connector, are included. The resulting mean-square error goes to zero with large channel bit-rates in a slower manner than the Shannon limit, which assumes a strictly bandlimited signal and perfect reconstruction.",['Kenneth Steiglitz'],50,[],Transmission of an analog signal over a fixed bit-rate channel,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,1966,80f6ffe4-1f6a-4b0c-afd7-3a3f2477e059

"A simple and yet powerful method of solving two of the more common numerical problems is heuristically derived and briefly discussed. The method makes possible the efficient solution of the zeros of a complex function, either transcendental or algebraic, of a complex variable. In addition, it is applicable to the computation of eigen values of a general matrix in which the parameter may appear in any elements of the matrix in a basically unrestricted way. The method is related to the classical secant and regula falsi methods for the finding of real zeros of a real function. Numerical examples of the method applied to several pathological matrices are presented.","['C. A. Barlow', 'E. L.

The message to be estimated may be contained in the transmitted signal in a nonlinear manner. The signal is corrupted by additive noise before observation. The received waveform is available over some observation interval [T_{i}, T_{f}] . We want to estimate a(t) over the same interval. Instead of considering explicit estimation procedures, we find bounds on how well any procedure The principle results are as follows: 1) a lower bound on the mean-square estimation error.

"The application of threshold logic to the design of sequential machines is the subject of this paper. A single layer of threshold logic units in the combinational portion of a sequential machine is used as the general model to be studied, and investigations have been made in the areas of autonomous machines, counters, sequence generators, and general input-output machines. This model was chosen for study because it offers the combined advantages of fewer components because of the use of threshold logic, along with very high-speed operation resulting from the use of only a single layer of logic. In some instances, namely for asynchronous machines, the only delay need be the natural delay of the single layer of threshold elements. Two state-assignment procedures are given for the synthesis of counters, both based on manipulations of C-matrices. The first results in counters having the minimum number of state variables; the second in race-free counters for which only one state variable changes per change of state. The modification of a given code to make it realizable with the chosen network is discussed and applied to the problem of outputs and sequence generators. Machines having inputs are considered and shown to present special problems; some of the difficulties involved are isolated. It is demonstrated that sometimes it is necessary to expand the state diagram by a state-splitting technique before the machine is realizable with the threshold network.","['Gilbert M.

"The problem of optimally terminating the sequential recognition procedure at a finite time prespecified by the designer is considered. The application arises, in practice, when the receptor (feature extraction) part of a sequential recognition machine has only a finite number of suitable features available to the categorizer (decision) part, or the cost of taking observation is found too high as the recognition process exceeds a certain time limit. In either case, the urgency to terminate the recognition procedure becomes greater when the available measurements are to be exhausted. The problem is studied by considering time-varying stopping boundaries for the sequential procedure such that by a preassigned length of time, the acceptance and rejection regions meet and, therefore, one of the pattern classes has to be accepted as the terminal decision. The idea of varying the stopping rules as a function of time enables us to investigate the behavior of a modified sequential test as compared to the standard Wald test with constant stopping boundaries. Computer simulation of English character recognition using the modified sequential test procedure indicates very satisfactory results.","['Yi-Tzuu Chien', 'King-Sun Fu']",50,['638981cd-abc4-4e7f-a4d5-41d76803af35'],A modified sequential recognition machine using time-varying stopping boundaries,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,1966,755c6227-4102-48f2-8170-7bcf7a4c742e
"In this report, certain properties of context-free (CF or type 2) grammars are investigated, like that of Chomsky. In particular, questions regarding structure, possible ambiguity and relationship to finite automata are considered. The following results are presented:   The language generated by a context-free grammmar is linear in a sense that is defined precisely.    The requirement of unambiguity—that every sentence has a unique phrase structure—weakens the grammar in the sense that there exists a CF language that cannot be generated unambiguously by a CF grammar.    The result that not every CF language is a finite automaton (FA) language is improved in the following way. There exists a CF language  L  such that for any  L′  ⊆  L , if  L′  is FA, an  L″  ⊆  L  can be found such that  L″  is also FA, L′ ⊆  L″  and  L″  contains infinitely many sentences not in  L′ .    A type of grammar is defined that is intermediate between type 1 and type 2 grammars.

The converter is built up with the following elements: controlled oscillator, saturated tuned amplifiers, detectors, and inverters. The converter principle is: a voltage input E 1  feeds a controlled oscillator whose output volttages are E 1  sin wt and?E sin wt, with E constant. These voltages feed the two sides of a voltage divider made up of resistors of convenient values. As the two voltages mentioned above are in phase opposition, one point of the divider, for each E 1 , presents zero potential.

An extension to the theory of linear programming over generalized networks is presented which replaces the generalized Kirchoff node conditions by chance constraints. The extension is motivated by a class of problems in sanitary and chemical engineering in which the nonzero entries in the generalized incidence matrix may be random variables. Duality relations are established for appropriate pairs of such chance-constrained programming problems by showing that their deterministic equivalents consist of a deterministic generalized network problem and its dual. It is also shown how these duality relations may be exploited in order to obtain actual solutions to chance-constrained generalized network problems.,"['A. Charnes', 'M. J. L. Kirby', 'William M.

We require the mean rate of flow through the system and the mean number of carriers waiting. Systems with a single carrier in the first link are considered initially, and the desired quantities are found by solving a set of simple linear equations. Since the number of equations increases with the number of carriers in the system, an approximation is examined for systems with a large number of carriers. Finally similar methods are seen to be appropriate for analyzing systems with several carriers in the first link provided the trip times are exponentially distributed.",['John T.

"A general canonical theory is developed for the systematic approximation of optimum, or Bayes, detection procedures in the critical limiting threshold mode of operation. The approximations to Bayes detectors introduced here are called locally optimum Bayes detectors (LOBD's) and are defined by the condition that they produce the same value of average risk and its derivative for vanishingly small input signals (\theta \rightarrow 0) as do the corresponding Bayes systems. The LOBD, x̂ , in the binary (i.e., two-alternative cases: H_{1} , signal and noise, vs. H_{0} , noise alone) is found to be the expansion of the logarithm of the optimum or likelihood ratio (functional) form \Lambda , including a suitable bias term, e.g., x̂ = \log \mu + B̂_{n}(\theta)+\theta \left( \frac{\delta \log \Lambda_{n}}{\delta \theta} \right)_{\theta = 0} \mbox{(1)} Suitable choices of bias B can frequently be made so that x̂ is asymptotically as efficient as x^{\ast} , the corresponding Bayes detector. The principal advantages of the LOBD are that 1) its comparative simplicity vis-a-vis the Bayes system, x^{\ast}; 2 ) its structure can always be found, even when the structure of the Bayes system cannot be obtained explicitly; and 3) expected performance (average risk and error probabilities) can often be determined for the LOBD when such is not possible for the Bayes system. In addition, the LOBD is canonically derived, i.e., the form of x̂ , (1), is independent of the particular noise statistics and signal, structure. New results include 1) the fact that the logarithm of the likelihood ratio is the function of the received data to be approximated, 2) correlated samples (including continuous sampling on an interval), 3) structures analogous to (1) which hold for the LOBD in binary sequential detection, and 4) similar expansions of the logarithm of the likelihood ratios, etc., which are required for the LOBD in multiple alternative cases. Moreover, in the binary situation of testing for signals (S_{1}) of one class against signals (S_{2}) of another in noise, the LOBD is seen to be a linearly weighted sum of characteristics like (1). To account for the effects of correlated samples and limiting distributions that do not obey the Central Limit Theorem, i.e., are not asymptotically normal (as illustrated in several of the examples), a criterion of asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE) _{\theta \geq 0 is developed. Sufficient, and necessary and sufficient conditions on the bias and on \^{\theta} itself are established, which when satisfied insure that the LOBD is at least asymptotically as efficient, or equivalent to, the corresponding Bayes detector in the limit.",['David Middleton'],11,[],Canonically optimum threshold detection,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,1966,f8457d10-dc42-4cba-a442-085ab5e8088c

The search stopping time can be determined as the search proceeds as in problems of sequential analysis. However, unlike many sequential analysis problems, the observational outcomes are somewhat within our control by a choice of observation or trial points. In common with problems of stochastic approximation, we attempt to determine the maximum of an unknown regression function. Contrary to many problems in stochastic approximation, though, the observations are noiseless, and the regression function is not required to be smooth or regular in the neighborhood of M . The main result is that the strategy minimizing the expected cost, drawn from the class of randomized, optional stopping strategies, is nonrandomized and of a size that can be fixed in advance of observation.",['Terrence L.

"The problem of determining optimal signal waveforms for transmission through a phase-incoherent channel is examined under the following conditions: 1) the channel adds white Gaussian noise to the signal, 2) the receiver is synchronized, 3) the receiver is designed to minimize probability of error, 4) all signals have equal energy, 5) all messages are, a priori, equiprobable, and 6) there is no bandwidth restriction on the signal set. This signal design problem is expressed as a variational problem involving a search for the optimal matrix in a specific class of non-negative-definite matrices, or, equivalently, involving a search for the optimal signal correlation set in a collection of admissible signal correlation sets. For all signal-to-noise ratios, the probability of error is shown to have a local extremum in the class of all admissible signal sets at the orthogonal signal set. This extremum is then classified as a local minimum by proving that the second-order variations are, indeed, always positive. The probability of error is then evaluated numerically for the orthogonal signal structure.","['Robert A. Scholtz', 'Charles L.

The decomposition algorithm presented here is designed to facilitate the analysis of such networks; the basic idea is to decompose the network into parts, apply one of the existing matrix methods to each part separately, and then to reunite the parts.

"This paper develops a theory of symmetric ternary switching functions and presents systematic methods for their detection, identification and synthesis. Shannon's theory of binary symmetric functions is extended to ternary functions by defining a set of five ``priming'' operations which, together with the ``permutation'' operations, form a group. Algebraic characterizations of totally and partially symmetric ternary functions are discussed. The method of detection and identification is based on a set of simple rules derived in terms of equalities of the residual functions of the given function with respect to pairs of variables of symmetry in a cyclic order. The notions of fundamental and simple symmetric ternary functions have been introduced and their algebraic properties have been studied. These concepts are then applied to develop a synthesis procedure which uses two basic 3-valued electronic gates recognizing the ``maximum'' or the ``minimum'' of the inputs.

"In some communication problems, it is a good assumption that the channel consists of an additive white Gaussian noise forward link and an essentially noiseless feedback link. In this paper, we study channels where no bandwidth constraint is placed on the transmitted signals. Such channels arise in space communications. It is known that the availability of the feedback link cannot increase the channel capacity of the noisy forward link, but it can considerably reduce the coding effort required to achieve a given level of performance. We present a coding scheme that exploits the feedback to achieve considerable reductions in coding and decoding complexity and delay over what would be needed for comparable performance with the best known (simplex) codes for the one-way channel. Our scheme, which was motivated by the Robbins-Monro stochastic approximation technique, can also be used over channels where the additive noise is not Gaussian but is still independent from instant to instant.

"The class of codes discussed in this paper has the property that its error-correction capability is described in terms of correcting errors in specific digits of a code word even though other digits in the code may be decoded incorrectly. To each digit of the code words is assigned an error protection level f_{i} . Then, if f errors occur in the reception of a code word, all digits which have protection f_{i} greater than or equal to f will be decoded correctly even though the entire code word may not be decoded correctly. Methods for synthesizing these codes are described and illustrated by examples. One method of synthesis involves combining the parity check matrices of two or more ordinary random error-correcting codes to form the parity check matrix of the new code. A decoding algorithm based upon the decoding algorithms of the component codes is presented. A second method of code generation is described which follows from the observation that for a linear code, the columns of the parity check matrix corresponding to the check positions must span the column space of the matrix. Upper and lower bounds are derived for the number of check digits required for such codes. The lower bound is based upon counting the number of unique syndromes required for a specified error-correction capability. The upper bound is the result of a constructive procedure for forming the parity check matrices of these codes.

"This paper presents a tabular method for synthesizing Boolean functions having four or less variables with multithreshold threshold elements.

All 2 2  4  functions of four variables are divided into 221 equivalence classes by variable complementations and/or permutations and/or function complementation. Each equivalence class is characterized by a subset of its corresponding Rademacher-Walsh coefficients, the size of the subset being determined by the number of thresholds required to realize that equivalence class. An arbitrary Boolean function of four or less variables is synthesized by systematically calculating subsets of its Rademacher-Walsh coefficients until, through simple equivalence operations, the equivalence class of the function is found in a table of the 221 equivalence classes. The table indicates a multithreshold realization of the given function. The table shows that any 4-variable function can be realized with at most five thresholds, or by a network of conventional, or single-threshold, threshold elements with at most three gates in which each gate has the identical weight vector for the four input variables.","['Donald R.

The optimization problem is then solved for all sampling rates up to 1/2 the Nyquist rate by the unique wave which never gives rise to more than one volt on the channel, just the magnitude of the data bits themselves. An upper bound is established on the worst channel voltage at higher rates by means of a class of pulses whose spectrum reduces to the optimum when the sampling rate parameter is chosen to be 1/2 the Nyquist rate. A time-domain optimization principle is stated which deals with zero manipulation, and the implications for the concept of dimensionality are discussed.

"The nearest neighbor decision rule assigns to an unclassified sample point the classification of the nearest of a set of previously classified points. This rule is independent of the underlying joint distribution on the sample points and their classifications, and hence the probability of error R of such a rule must be at least as great as the Bayes probability of error R^{\ast} --the minimum probability of error over all decision rules taking underlying probability structure into account. However, in a large sample analysis, we will show in the M -category case that R^{\ast} \leq R \leq R^{\ast}(2 --MR^{\ast}/(M-1)) , where these bounds are the tightest possible, for all suitably smooth underlying distributions. Thus for any number of categories, the probability of error of the nearest neighbor rule is bounded above by twice the Bayes probability of error.

"The feasibility of transmitting blocks of words between memory and CPU is the subject of this study. The question is pertinent to the design of very fast computing systems where the nanoseconds to traverse a few feet become significant. There is intuitive advantage to transmitting blocks of words, rather than a word at a time. The initial access time due to physical distance, effective address mapping, and priority is a few hundred nanoseconds. If this time could be prorated against several words, then the  effective  access time could be reduced to a few tens of nanoseconds. The question is, of course, can the extra words be useful to the CPU?   This question was explored in a simulation model driven by customer-based IBM 7000 series data. The simulation results indicate that blocks of 4, 8, or 16 words, transmitted to a local storage of 2K to 4K words, will adequately prorate memory access time. With this configuration, block transfer is seen to be an efficient memory access method which can provide high performance, superior to single-word access.",['Donald H.

"Abstract : A description is given of a sophisticated computer program for the syntactic analysis of natural languages. The study discusses the notation used to write rules and the extent to which these rules can be made to state the same linguistic facts as a transformational grammar. Whereas most existing programs apply context-free phrase-structure grammars, this new program can analyze sentences with context-sensitive grammars and with grammars of a class very similar to transformational grammars. The program, which is written for the IBM 7040/44 computer, is nondeterministic: The various interpretations of an ambiguous sentence are all worked on simultaneously; at no stage does the program develop one interpretation rather than another. If two interpretations differ only in some small part of a partial syntactic structure, then only one complete structure is stored with two versions of the ambiguous part. The unambiguous portion is worked on only once for both interpretations. Although the current version of the program is written in ALGOL, with very little regard for efficiency, the basic algorithm is inherently much more efficient than any of its competitors.

"Cellular logic arrays are beginning to take on an increasingly greater importance in digital technology, mainly because of their numerous advantages for the design, manufacture, and use in digital systems employing large-scale integrated semiconductor arrays. Particularly significant among these advantages is the feature of testability. One would naturally expect that the iterative structure and the short intercell connections of a cellular logic array would allow it to be tested from its edge terminals much more easily than a relatively disorganized interconnection of the same number of gates. In this paper we confirm this conjecture, and we describe procedures for deriving minimal (or near-minimal) schedules of test inputs, to be applied to a combinational cellular array in order to detect the presence of any single faulty cell. In addition, necessary and sufficient conditions are presented for some types of arrays of unilaterally connected, identical cells to be completely testable for single faults. For one-dimensional arrays, these conditions are based upon known results in sequential network theory. For two-dimensional arrays, a relationship to the ""domino problem"" (which is known to be insoluble) is described, but is shown to be largely avoidable and nonrestricting in the present case.",['William H.

The other classes use a basically different method of achieving synchronization, and have even higher efficiencies than the F codes.

"A theory of reverberation and related first-order scattered fields is developed, based on the assumption of weak inhomogeneities (i.e., primary scattering only), and a consequent representation in terms of Poisson point processes in space and time. Both surface and volume reverberation are included, separately and together, for general geometries, source and receiver at the same and different locations, and arbitrary transmitting and receiving apertures. A combination of field- and ray-theory is employed to obtain a characteristic scattered waveform, where the inhomogeneous medium is replaced by a homogeneous and isotropic one in which a spatially and temporally random ensemble of point scatterers is embedded. The effects of the scattering mechanism are described generally by a linear, time-varying filter response. The medium itself is seen to be dispersive and is represented by a set of linear (statistical) space-time operators, by which the signal source and the receiver are coupled to one another, as well as to the point scatterers. Broadband as well as narrowband signals and reverberation are included in the model, which is capable of handling general apertures, illuminating signals, doppler of the scatterers, multiple sources and receivers (overlapping beams), and a characteristic time-varying scatter mechanism, that reveals in detail the inherent nonstationarity of the reverberation. Shadowing effects of ""rough"" surfaces are included, and a variety of important special results, such as the case of narrowband excitation, and simple (time- and frequency-independent) scattering, are also described. The emphasis is on broadband (frequency-dependent) structures, and their associated space-time operators, by which the system as a whole is represented, and with the help of which one can apply the general methods of statistical communication theory to the central problems of signal processing for detection, communication, and classification, in an environment dominated by reverberation or clutter and analogous signal-dependent noise processes.",['David Middleton'],8,['7822c7de-80b3-4962-9829-0135bbe50d05'],A statistical theory of reverberation and similar first-order scattered fields--I: Waveforms and the general process,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,1967,acc6290a-bce8-44a6-98be-6b2c18a50265

"A new kind of machine is proposed, in which the continuous variable is represented as a probability of a pulse occurrence at a certain sampling time. It is shown that threshold gates can be used as simple and inexpensive processors such as adders and multipliers. In fact, for a random-pulse sequence, any Boolean operation among individual pulses will correspond to an algebraic expression among the variables represented by their respective average pulse-rates. So, any logical gate or network performs an algebraic operation. Considering the possible simplicity of these random-pulse processors, large systems can be built to perform parallel analog computation on large amounts of input data. The conventional analog computer has a topological simulation structure that can be readily carried over to the processing of functions of time and of one, two, or perhaps even three space variables. Facility of gating, inherent to any form of pulse-coding, allows the construction of stored-connection parallel analog computers made to process functions of time and two space variables. This paper considers this technique of random-pulse computation and its potential implications. Problems of realization, application examples, and alternate coding schemes are discussed.

"In sequential decoding, the number of computations which the decoder must perform to decode the received digits is a random variable. In this paper, we derive a Paretian lower bound to the distribution of this random variable. We show that P [C > L]  L^{-\rho} , where C is the number of computations which the sequential decoder must perform to decode a block of \Lambda transmitted bits, and is a parameter which depends on the channel and the rate of the code. Our bound is valid for all sequential decoding schemes and all discrete memoryless channels. In Section II we give an example of a special channel for which a Paretian bound can be easily derived. In Sections III and IV we treat the general channel. In Section V we relate this bound to the memory buffer requirements of real-time sequential decoders. In Section VI, we show that this bound implies that certain moments of the distribution of the computation per digit are infinite, and we determine lower bounds to the rates above which these moments diverge. In most cases, our bounds coincide with previously known upper bounds to rates above which the moments converge. We conclude that the performance of systems using sequential decoding is limited by the computational and buffer capabilities of the decoder, not by the probability of making a decoding error. We further note that our bound applies only to sequential decoding, and that, in certain special cases (Section II), algebraic decoding methods prove superior.","['Irwin M. Jacobs', 'Elwyn R.

For two special jitter distributions the joint optimization problem is solved without a bandwidth limitation, and the resulting systems are found to be band-limited.

"This paper discusses networks (directed graphs) having one input node, one output node, and an arbitrary number of intermediate nodes, whose branches are noisy communications channels, in which the input to each channel appears at its output corrupted by additive Gaussian noise.

A branch originating at a node has as input a linear combination of the outputs of the branches terminating at that node. The channel capacity of such a network is defined. Its value is bounded in terms of branch parameter values and procedures for computing values for general networks are described.

"Consider a circular central business district of a city with n evenly spaced radial streets and m circular streets. We assume that during the evening rush hour driver origins are all inside the city and exits at the circumference with a joint distribution that depends only upon the relative angle between original and final radii, and the radial coordinate of the origin. Travel time on any directed link is assumed to be a function of the flow along that directed link and the radial coordinate of the link. For a flow of Q vehicles per hour leaving the city, our problem is to find an assignment of drivers to paths such that every driver follows a path of minimum travel time between his origin and exit. This extends some work of Smeed who considers a similar model with no flow dependence of the travel time and a uniform distribution of origins. It is first shown that this circularly symmetric system gives rise to a circularly symmetric optimal flow pattern. This flow pattern can be generated by assigning each driver to a path that uses at most one of the circular streets. Eventually the assignment is expressed explicitly as a function of 2( m - 1) unknown parameters that satisfy a system of equations and/or inequalities. The general solution of these equations were not found, but solutions were obtained for a number of special cases that showed the effect of congestion at the center and the effect of a belt expressway. Differential equations were also obtained for n (rightarrow) (infinity) and m (rightarrow) (infinity).","['Tenny Lam', 'G. F.

"This paper describes a case study of selected inventory accounts maintained by a large manufacturer of rocket engines. It was hypothesized that a significant improvement in average inventory levels, number of purchase orders, and number of stockouts could be obtained by augmenting existing methods of inventory management with certain OR based techniques. These techniques included exponential smoothing of demand forecasts and statistical determination of optimum safety stock levels. Computerized simulation was used to determine: 1 the most effective parameter α values for use in the exponential smoothing formulas, 2 an estimate of the potential dollar savings obtainable if the proposed methods were implemented, and 3 a means by which these methods could be implemented. A simulation model was developed for two particular inventory accounts, its correspondence with the real world was tested, and the alpha values and anticipated dollar values were determined. Additionally, a set of curves were developed for use by inventory management to assist in determining an optimized policy for varying values of purchase order cost, inventory carrying rate, and cost of stockouts.",['Arnold H.

"In an early paper [1], McCluskey and Unger counted the number of distinct state assignments for synchronous sequential machines. Their formula, however, does not account for all distinct state assignments when the memory function in a realization is performed by delay elements alone. This note amends their formula by establishing the conditions for its validity and by deriving the appropriate expression under other conditions. An example illustrating the effect of using the McCluskey-Unger formula in a case where it does not apply can be found in a recent paper by Dolotta and McCluskey [2]. In their paper, a procedure is proposed for selecting a state assignment that has an associated economical realization. Their method implicitly restricts the memory units to be delay elements, and some distinct state assignments are not considered. Consequently, a number of realizations are over-looked. A minor modification in the Dolotta-McCluskey algorithm is suggested so that all distinct state assignments are taken into account. In some cases this revised procedure results in a more economical realization than the unmodified one.","['Peter Weiner', 'E. J.

Subsets of the balloon automata of each variety, called closed classes are defined. Almost all the known types of automata are equivalent to some closed class of balloon automata. Properties of closed classes are given. For example, whatever the variety, the languages accepted by a closed class are closed under intersection with a regular set. For a given organization of storage, closed classes of the four varieties can be defined. These four classes are said to form a family.

"Traffic flow past a point varies with time owing partly to statistical fluctuations and partly to a variation in the mean. Highway traffic surveys frequently include as a measure of this variation, peak short-time flows (1-, 5-, or 15-min flows) during a longer time (15, 30, or 60 min). Near the peak of the rush hour, the expected flow should be nearly stationary and variation in short-time flows should be due mostly to statistical fluctuations. This paper describes methods for estimation of these peak flows under the assumption that the short-time flows are approximately a stationary Gaussian process with a variance-to-mean ratio of about 1. The theory suggests that one can predict the distribution of peak short-time flows (5-min flows, for example) from the peak long-time flows (15 or 30 min flows). Experimental data seem to confirm this. The implication is that these short-time peaks have no obvious relation to highway capacity beyond that already inferred from the longer-time flows.",['G. F.

"This paper presents derivations of expressions for the probability of killing a randomly located point target and for the expected coverage of an area target of variable density. Particular emphasis is placed upon a general situation in which the phase distribution is not necessarily uniform. General distributions are employed to describe the phase, radial, and component behavior of the target and from these functions the distribution of a quadratic form is derived that provides the expected coverage or kill probability. The targeting conditions include a fixed lethal radius kill-no-kill when the center of gravity of the weapon impact points coincides with the center of the target density and a variable lethal radius when a weapon bias is present.",['Frank McNolty'],50,['6d705ff7-b567-4635-8368-b1962cdddb4e'],Expected Coverage for Targets of Nonuniform Density,Operations Research,1968,e8971830-9801-4d3b-8b06-46476a93c656
"This paper is concerned with the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) nonlinear prediction of a class of random processes. A class of random processes is defined by the property that its MMSE zero-memory predictor is represented by a finite sum of separable terms. Sufficient conditions for the existence of such processes are also considered. The nonlinear predictor is restricted to be composed of a linear filter in parallel with a zero-memory nonlinearity (ZNL) preceded by a variable delay, The optimum predictor is shown to be the solution of linear integral equations with the same kernel as for the optimum linear predictor. The first step of the derivation also yields a simpler scheme which ,only requires the addition of a ZNL to the optimum linear predictor. The improvements in the MMSE of the two nonlinear systems over the linear case are compared and illustrated by a numerical example.",['Abraham H.

The purpose of this paper is to gain a better understanding of the structure of undecidable problems in automata theory by investigating the degree of unsolvability of these problems. This is achieved by using Turing machines with oracles to define when one undecidable problem can be reduced to another and to establish an infinite hierarchy of (equivalent) undecidable problems. This hierarchy is then used to classify well-known undecidable problems about various families of automata and formal languages and to study the relations between these problems. This approach reveals a well defined structuring of the undecidable problems and permits a more systematic study of these problems and their relation to various families of automata.,"['Juris Hartmanis', 'John E.

"A recurring communications systems problem involves the determination, with relatively high precision, of the phase of a periodic, noise-corrupted signal. Perhaps the most commonly proposed signals for such purposes are pseudorandom sequences. Indeed, such signals are known to be optimum, at least when the noise is white and Gaussian, in the sense of minimizing the time needed to find the correct phase with a specified reliability. Equipment limitations, however, often preclude the efficient use of these sequences. In particular, suppose the received signal is known to be of the form y(t) = x(t - \nu \Delta T) + n(t) , with x(t) a signal periodic with period T , and n(t) additive white Gaussian noise. The problem is to determine as reliably and rapidly as possible the ""phase"" \nu of the received signal. The optimum detector involves the formation of the N = \Delta T/T correlations I_{\nu} = \int y(t)x(t - \nu \Delta T) dt and the selection of the largest of these. Frequently, however, equipment constraints force these correlations to be made serially. In this event, the required search time can be as much as N times as great as that needed in the absence of such constraints. Even the most sophisticated sequential search algorithms require search times directly proportional to N , the number of contending phases. In this paper a class of binary sequences is demonstrated which require a search time on the order of only (log2 N)2, a substantial improvement when N is large. These sequences are shown to be essentially optimum under the conditions outlined.",['J. J.

"A method is presented for selecting a subset of features from a specified set when economic considerations prevent utilization of the complete set. The formulation of the feature selection problem as a dynamic programming problem permits an optimal solution to feature selection problems which previously were uncomputable. Although optimality is defined in terms of a particular measure, the Fisher return function, other criteria may be substituted as appropriate to the problem at hand. This mathematical model permits the study of interactions among processing time, cost, and probability of correctly classifying patterns, thus illustrating the advantages of dynamic programming. The natural limitation of the model is that the only features which can be selected are those supplied by its designer.

This paper investigates the problem of efficiently allocating computer time between two simulation experiments when the objective is to make a statistical comparison of means. For a given level of accuracy our results show that significantly less computer time is required when the sample sizes are determined according to a certain rule than when the sample sizes are equal. A graphical analysis suggests that small errors in estimating the population parameters of the allocation rule do not significantly affect the efficient allocation of time. The influence that the degree of autocorrelation has on the time allocation is also investigated; results show that small differences in the autocorrelation functions are important when each process is highly autocorrelated. Positively correlated samples for the two experiments are examined and incorporated into the efficient allocation rule. It is shown that their use leads to a saving in computer time.

"A class of learning stochastic automata can be defined by the sextuple {S, F, ?, g, ??, T} where S is the input set, F is the finite set of r outputs (or strategies) of the automaton, ? is the finite set of r states, g is the output function which is a one-to-one mapping between the states and the outputs, ?? is the state probability vector whose ith component is the probability of the ith state being chosen. T is the reinforcement operator which guides the automaton in its learning by specifying the manner in which ?? is to be changed in response to the environment. The environment is specified by the penalty structure; namely, its response in the form of penalties to the outputs of the automaton. The reinforcement scheme enables the automaton to choose its outputs in such a manner as to reduce the mean penalty. This paper considers the collective behavior of the above finite state stochastic automata. This is of interest in view of the possibility of modelling group behavior of subjects in terms of these automata. The natural language for considering the collective behavior is that of game theory. After a brief introduction to a class of deterministic automata, the stochastic automaton is formulated and a nonlinear reinforcement specified. The finite state stochastic automaton is first considered in a game with nature, and conditions under which the automaton's winnings reach the von Neumann value of the game are established. Next, two stochastic automata with arbitrary number of states for each are considered in a game, the game matrix being specified. Performance of the automata for various conditions on the elements of the game matrix is considered. In a comparison of performance with deterministic automata, it is established that for performance comparable to that of the finite state stochastic automaton, the deterministic automaton needs an infinite number of states. Finally some games are simulated on a computer which verifies the general analysis and further throws light on the details of the game.","['B. Chandrasekaran', 'D. W. C.

Abstract—A method is presented for realizing any flow table that does not contain essential hazards with a circuit requiring no delay elements for proper operation. The procedure generally requires considerably fewer state variables than did an earlier technique for achieving the same result. It is based on a modification of a method by Tracey for constructing single-transition-time row assignments.,['Stephen H.

"The overall goal, of which this paper is a part, is the development of a machine-independent data structure allowing rapid processing of data related by arbitrary assignment such as: the contents of a telephone book, library files, census reports, family lineage, graphic displays, information retrieval systems, networks, etc. Data which are non-intrinsically related have to be expressed (stored) in such a way as to define the way in which they are related before  any  data structure is applicable. Since any relation can be expressed in set theory as a set of ordered pairs and since set theory provides a wealth of operations for dealing with relations, a set-theoretic data structure appears worth investigation.",['David L.

"A 2-stage classification model is presented in which the first stage is a quick, computerized Bayes rule decision device, and the second a slow, but perfectly accurate, classifier. A stationary stream of elements or objects to be classified into one of several mutually exclusive categories is fed into the model. The conditional probabilities associated with the Bayes device are assumed unknown at the outset, except up to an initial probability distribution. The a posteriori probabilities from the first stage are treated as information that can speed up or slow down the processing time in the second stage. The latter, after a delay time, feeds back accurate classification information to the first stage to update the conditional probabilities. It is shown that, as the classification process unfolds, any updating scheme that causes the Bayes classifier ultimately to learn the true values of the conditional probabilities also minimizes the expected processing time in the second stage. The learning rate of the system is discussed as a function of the updating scheme. An example of a simple system is presented and the learning rate is derived specifically for that case.","['Charles E. Theobald', 'David W. C.

"Abstract : One of the principal hurdles in developing multiplexed computer systems is acquiring sufficient insight into the apparently complex problems encountered. The paper isolates two system objectives by distinguishing between problems related to multiplexing and those arising from sharing of information. In both cases, latent problems of noninteractive systems are shown to be aggravated by interacting people. Viewpoints such as reversibility of binding, and mechanisms such as segmentation, are suggested as approaches to acquiring insight. It is argued that only such analysis and functional understanding can lead to simplifications needed to allow design of more sophisticated systems. (Author)","['F. J. Corbató', 'Jerome H.

The technique is based upon the fact that not all sub-commands are required in all words so that bits of the memory may be time shared between subcommands. The algorithm provides a means for determining what sub-commands should share a common set of bits. The algorithm is essentially one of exhaustive evaluation but it is one that directs you toward the solution rather than one which randomly tries all possible solutions and chooses the best. In addition certain bounds on the ""size"" of the solution are derived and these in turn eliminate a large segment of the possible solution set from consideration.

"Sequential decision models have heretofore assumed a full memory decision maker. That is, the model is permitted to retain, to any degree of precision, all information needed to optimize decision performance. This information may include functions or variables that change with observations and thus often implies a decision maker which possesses a large amount of soft (erasable) memory. In simple multistage decision problems soft memory can be reduced to two variables?the log-odds ratio L and the available number of observations n. The log-odds ratio is a quantitative measure of the decision maker's opinion of the cause of the observed variate. This paper examines the effect of limiting the decision maker's soft memory by specifying an m-bit register for the random variable L. The theory for limited memory multistage decision processes is presented in which there are two simple hypotheses. Numerical results indicate that the 3-bit memory is, for practical purposes, equivalent to a full memory decision maker.","['Clifford T. Miullis', 'Richard A.

Unfortunately, an optimal solution to the group problem may yield an infeasible integer solution. The algorithm GTIP2 of this paper is an extension of the method of part I when it fails. In particular, GTIP2 employs a search procedure to find an optimal solution to the integer programming problem.

"Time-sharing of computer facilities has been widely acclaimed as the most significant evolutionary step that has been taken in recent years toward the development of generalized information utilities. The basic techniques of interactive man-computer time-sharing were developed in the 1950's in connection with realtime command and control computing systems, initially in SAGE air defense. Time-sharing was practiced in these pioneering systems in the sense that many military operators at separate consoles --- consoles equipped with push-buttons, CRT displays and light guns---were able to request and receive information from the central computing system at essentially the same time. These historical roots reveal that time-sharing is an outgrowth of realtime system development.",['Harold Sackman'],50,"['cc2c4579-6b92-429c-9702-b80cdcc6a025', 'd07ff895-9f01-4215-9e3b-fe0feb05324f', 'd597b2d5-bceb-4ed8-82b9-392e0e367ce4']",Time-sharing versus batch processing: the experimental evidence,,1968,d202c6bb-97bd-4fdf-b47a-d65b08da32cd

"Table languages are extensions of finite state languages and context free languages. Table languages have access to a table on each generation step. Table entries are an ordered pair: (attribute,identifier). The collection of attributes comprise a finite set while the collection of identifiers comprise an infinite regular set.

A partitioned table language generator is a restriction on an arbitrary table language generator having only 1:1 table to terminal mappings while retaining the partitioning of the set of undeclared identifiers.

"A checking automaton is equivalent to a one-way nonerasing stack automaton which, once it enters its stack, never again writes on its stack. The checking automaton languages (cal) form a full AFL closed under substitution. If L ⊆ a* is an infinite cal, then L contains an infinite regular set. Consequently, there are one-way nonerasing stack languages (such as (an2|n≥1|)) which are not cal. Let L be the family of one-way stack languages and let L1 be a subAFL of L. L is closed under substitution into L1 if and only if L1 is contained in the family of context-free languages. L is closed under substitution by L1 if and only if L1 is a family of cal.

"This paper is basically concerned with determining readback distortion in magnetic recording. This determination is obtained, not by closed-form analysis, but by simulation of the readback system, consisting of the head and load. The simulation environment allows the author to avoid two limiting assumptions of the past. In this case, he is able to treat a head of finite permeability and a nonzero load. The load considered is a rather standard and adequate parallel RC network. For the finite permeability head, an RL series equivalent circuit is used in which the resistance and inductance are frequency dependent and determined experimentally. The argument is made that the open-circuit readback voltage (zero load) is linear with the input (variation of flux in the storage medium). This fact allows superposition to be applied, and the actual readback voltage computed at the various harmonics of the input. Since R and L vary with frequency, a different equivalent circuit of the head applies for each harmonic. The analysis and superposition of the linear network responses for each network is performed digitally.

"The electronic digital computer has been with us for only a single human generation. When spawned in World War II, the human motivation behind its birth and development was in the tradition stemming from the ancient abacus up to the digital machines used by Pascal, Leibnitz, and Babbage---to relieve the tedium of laborious computation through machine assistance. Babbage was attracted to computers because of the endless, repetitive work necessary to produce logarithmic tables; von Neumann's early interest in computers grew from its potential as a shortcut computational aid in such problems as the analysis of atomic reactions.",['Harold Sackman'],50,[],A public philosophy for real time information systems,,1968,d6a7fca5-54c2-4c38-aa49-b2807316192c
"A formalism is defined in which solutions to theorem-proving and similar problems take the form of a sequence of transformations of states into other states. The data used to solve a problem then consists of a set of rewriting rules which defines the allowable transformations. A method for selecting “useful” transformations, i.e. those which will most probably lead to a solution, is developed.  Two problem-solving processes based on the above are defined; one, called the FORTRAN Deductive System (FDS) is shown to be more powerful than the other. A class of problems to which FDS will always find solutions is constructed. Examples of solutions found by a computer implementation of FDS are given and, in some cases, are compared with human performance.  Finally, FDS is compared with some of the better-known problem-solving systems.","['J. R.

Equations are presented for approximate minimum mean-square error estimates of a Markovian state vector observed in a signal in which it is imbedded nonlinearly. A general model for analog communication via randomly time-varying channels is given and related to the state-vector estimation problem. The model includes as special cases such linear and nonlinear modulation schemes as AM, PM, FM, and PM _{n} /PM; and such continuous channels as Rayleigh and Rician channels, fixed channels with memory, and diversity channels.

They differ only in the order in which nested terms may be expanded: IO is expansion from the inside-out; OI from the outside-in. Both classes, in common with the context-free, have decidable emptiness and derivation problems, and both are closed under the operations of union, concatenation, Kleene closure (star), reversal, intersection with a regular set, and arbitrary homomorphism. OI languages are also closed under inverse homomorphism while IO languages are not.

"A Bayesian decision theory approach is applied to the solution of the problem of unsupervised parametric pattern recognition. The parametric model for this investigation includes the cases where both constant and time-varying unknown parameters are present, and, most significantly, the unknown hypotheses do not constitute a statistically independent sequence. They are restricted only to be from a source with finite-order Markov dependence. The resulting optimal learning system is found and shown to grow initially in size and memory until the N th observation (where N is the highest Markov order), and subsequently to remain of fixed size and memory. It can, therefore, operate indefinitely and continue to improve its ability to recognize patterns utilizing only a fixed size memory. In summary, the main contributions of this paper are the following: \begin{enumerate} \item the extension of previous investigations of the unsupervised parametric pattern recognition problem to include cases where both constant and time-varying unknown parameter vectors are simultaneously present; \item that the a priori probabilities of the hypotheses, the time-varying parameters, and their transition laws may, if constant, be expressed as functions of the constant unknown parameter and, thus, also be learned; and \item the removal of the assumption of statistical independence between hypotheses for the sequence of observations. \end{enumerate}","['Charles G.

"The purpose of this paper is to generalize the methods of automata theory to accommodate infinite input alphabets and to propose a method of describing computer languages such as ALGOL-60 with more reliance on grammatical methods and less reliance on semantic constraints. Our chief concern is a natural generalization of a context-free grammar which we call a context-free property grammar. The generalization is straight-forward and can be used in similar fashion to define regular property grammars, context-sensitive property grammars, etc. The chief result is that these contextfree property grammars generate precisely the set of languages recognized by a non-determinated pushdown table machine, which is a straight forward generalization of a pushdown machine. Again it is clear that other kinds of automata have corresponding table versions. The language-machine correspondence is preserved in such a matter that efficient processing schemes for context-free property grammars are suggested by the well-known schemes for context free languages. Before beginning, we mention some mathematical conventions used. If A is a set, then A* represents the set of all finite sequences of elements from A. If w is in A*, then l(w) is the length of word w. The symbol ∈ represents the null or length zero word. A typical element of A* will be described by ai...an with the understanding that if n = 0, the null string ∈ is represented and there are no ai in the string. If n is a positive integer, then An represents the set of n dimensional vectors whose components are from A. A typical element of An is represented as (ai,..., an). If I is a set, then AI represents the set of all functions from I to A. Finally 2A represents the set of all subsets of A.","['Richard Edwin Stearns', 'Philip M.

"The decision analysis described considers four major installation development alternatives upon which management decisions were required. The analysis has a number of phases. The technical-economic system is first modeled deterministically to describe the characteristics of the business. The deterministic model, or expected value business model, is then exercised in a sensitivity phase to determine what parameters are most influential to the outcomes. The analysis uses present worth methods for the time preference for money. Pricing strategies and market feedback capability are included. Adjunct businesses that develop as a result of the original business have been modeled in the deterministic model. The deterministic or nominal value outcomes show a clear progression of improvement over a 20 year period for the more technically advanced installation developments. The cost of development is an influential contributor to deterministic outcomes. The influence on near term outcomes of development costs was sufficient to make the issue of time value of outcomes very significant. The value of identifying the short term and long term outcomes on the basis of the time value of outcomes becomes identifiable as a significant contribution to decision making. The thinking which contributed to choosing the parameters used in the uncertainty analysis proved to be an important means of clarifying the issues surrounding what uncertainty analysis of a given development alternative venture really consists of.",['W.

We then derive a necessary and sufficient condition that the above property holds for all 1 \leq \varrho  (even then, different values of o would, in general, induce different optimal input distributions).

"A stochastic automaton responds to the penalties from a random environment through a reinforcement scheme by changing its state probability distribution in such a way as to reduce the average penalty received. In this manner the automaton is said to possess a variable structure and the ability to learn. This paper discusses the efficiency of learning for an m-state automaton in terms of expediency and convergence, under two distinct types of reinforcement schemes: one based on penalty probabilities and the other on penalty strengths. The functional relationship between the successive probabilities in the reinforcement scheme may be either linear or nonlinear. The stability of the asymptotic expected values of the state probability is discussed in detail. The conditions for optimal and expedient behavior of the automaton are derived. Reduction of the probability of suboptimal performance by adopting the Beta model of the mathematical learning theory is discussed. Convergence is discussed in the light of variance analysis. The initial learning rate is used as a measure of the overall convergence rate. Learning curves can be obtained by solving nonlinear difference equations relating the successive expected values. An analytic expression concerning the convergence behavior of the linear case is derived. It is shown that by a suitable choice of the reinforcement scheme it is possible to increase the separation of asymptotic state probabilities.","['B. Chandrasekaran', 'David W. C.

"An infinite sequence over a finite alphabet is regular if the indices of those positions at which each given symbol occurs in the sequence constitute a set of numbers which in suitable base is recognizable by a finite automaton. A sequence obtained by deleting from a regular sequence all occurrences of certain symbols is semi-regular. Semi-regular sequences are alternatively characterizable as those which are the real-time generable output of tag machines with deletion number one, regular sequences as those generable by such machines additionally constrained to have tag productions with consequents of uniform length. A real number is called regular or semi-regular if its expansion in some base is a sequence of corresponding type. As a consequence of the fact that the operation of a tag machine can be described by a system of functional equations of standard form, it can be shown that no regular real number is algebraic irrational. This generalizes to include those semi-regular reals generable by tag machines in the operation of which the gap between read head and write head increases proportionately with time.

Thus, repeat requests for service from the pool of unsatisfied customers are superimposed on the normal stream of arrivals of first attempts. This system is characteristic of situations in which there is a single operator or source of information that must be called and busy signals are not held.

ALGOL procedures can in turn be called by string procedures so that numeric and symbolic processes may conveniently be programmed together. Concatenation and a variant of SNOBOL's pattern matching make up a set of primitive commands. These are assembled together into conditional expressions which are to be used to provide alternative computational patterns. Arrays of strings are processed using quantifiers.

"The problem of simultaneous detection and estimation of signals in noise is formulated in the language of statistical decision theory. Optimum structures and corresponding general measures of system performance are derived under the Bayes criterion of minimum average risk for the detectors and estimators appropriate to this type of joint operation: It is shown that whereas the structures of the resulting optimum detectors require a class of modified likelihood ratios, the structures of the optimum estimators, which act on the data when there is uncertainty as to the presence of a signal [p(H_{1})  , have a common canonical form for a wide variety of operating strategies. This form is identical with that obtained for estimation alone [p(H_{1})  , even though there is generally mutual coupling between detector and extractor. A simple structure is obtained for the estimation of amplitude and waveform in the case of a quadratic cost function (least mean-square error), where it is found that the estimator which is optimum here [p(H_{1})  is the product of the corresponding Bayes estimator in the ""classical"" case [P(H1) = 1 ] and a simple algebraic function of the generalized likelihood ratio. In this case, one can also show that estimators that are unbiased in the classical sense remain unbiased. In parallel with the classical theory, a generalized version of unconditional maximum likelihood estimation is obtained for the ""simple"" cost function when p(H_{1}  . It is found that estimators that are linear in the classical case [p(H_{1}) = 1 ] are nonlinear in the more general situation [p(H_{1}) , where increased structural complexity is always the rule for both detectors and estimators. A specific example involving the coherent estimation of signal amplitude illustrates the approach. Analogous extensions to prediction and filtering are formulated, making it evident that a broad area for further generalizations of classical Bayes detection and extraction theory is available for systematic investigation.","['David Middleton', 'Raffaele Esposito']",243,"['817ccd46-5d38-4c54-aefd-93e8c794adea', '916faa61-d00f-4156-a5ac-afa844a504f0', 'f8457d10-dc42-4cba-a442-085ab5e8088c']",Simultaneous optimum detection and estimation of signals in noise,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,1968,a38001c2-4cd8-4222-bb92-905f8fdaafb9
"Communication systems are considered in which there exists an auxiliary channel over which the receiver can make requests for retransmission. In general, it is assumed that the auxiliary channel is noiseless and the main channel is discrete and memoryless. It is also assumed that the a priori probabilities of the message symbols are known. A sequential receiver strategy is introduced which at each step minimizes the probability of retransmission subject to the condition that the probability of incorrect decoding does not exceed a given limit. The strategy is easy to implement in the case where group codes are used as error correctors and detectors. Moreover, in this case, conditions are given for which the strategy terminates with probability I, regardless of whether it is truncated. Examples are given for illustration.","['R. G.

"In a previous paper we obtained characterizations of constraint sets determined by a finite number of differentiate pseudoconcave constraint functions possessing an interior point, and showed that they are convex Lagrange regular. In this paper we introduce a weaker type of constraint qualification and obtain asymptotic Lagrange regularity conditions from the constructs of semi-infinite programming. We impose the constraint qualification that each constraint function possess an interior point, possibly different for different constraint functions. Computationally speaking, it is relatively easy to verify since each constraint function is examined individually for interior points in consistent problems. Artificial vectors are adjoined to the dual problem and within the constructs of this problem involving no new data, convergence is assured asymptotically to Lagrangian type conditions.

"Experiments have been performed on the fusional vergence eye-movement mechanism in humans to provide a comparison with the established dynamical characteristics of the versional eye-movement system. Transient and frequency response experiments indicate that the fusional vergence system is not characterized by sampled data or refractory operation. When provided with a periodic input, this system may utilize prediction to reduce inherent phase lags. The gain of the system, although apparently unaffected by the predictive mechanism, is subject to input amplitude-dependent nonlinearities. Under conditions of artificially high loop gain, the system breaks into smooth sustained oscillations at a frequency predicted by frequency response data. The absence of a refractory period in the fusional vergence system is demonstrated by the system response to brief pulsatile stimulation.

"The error-propagation effect in decoding convolutional codes is a result of the internal feedback in the usual decoding method, feedback decoding (FD). As a measure of this effect, the propagation length L of a system is defined as the maximum span of decoding errors following a decoding error when all succeding parity checks are satisfied. A relationship between L , the parity check matrix, and the decoding algorithm is developed. A decoding method having no internal feedback, definite decoding (DD), is formalized. It is shown that a code using FD with limited L exists if and only if that same code can be decoded using DD. When using DD a smaller class of errors is corrected. The self-orthogonal codes are shown to be decodable using FD with L small. The minimum possible value of L when using bounded distance decoding is given for some of these codes. Codes are given which minimize the spacing between single correctable errors using DD.

"In decision theory, mathematical analysis shows that once the sampling distribution, loss function, and sample are specified, the only remaining basis for a choice among different admissible decisions lies in the prior probabilities. Therefore, the logical foundations of decision theory cannot be put in fully satisfactory form until the old problem of arbitrariness (sometimes called ""subjectiveness"") in assigning prior probabilities is resolved. The principle of maximum entropy represents one step in this direction. Its use is illustrated, and a correspondence property between maximum-entropy probabilities and frequencies is demonstrated. The consistency of this principle with the principles of conventional ""direct probability"" analysis is illustrated by showing that many known results may be derived by either method. However, an ambiguity remains in setting up a prior on a continuous parameter space because the results lack invariance under a change of parameters; thus a further principle is needed. It is shown that in many problems, including some of the most important in practice, this ambiguity can be removed by applying methods of group theoretical reasoning which have long been used in theoretical physics. By finding the group of transformations on the parameter space which convert the problem into an equivalent one, a basic desideratum of consistency can be stated in the form of functional equations which impose conditions on, and in some cases fully determine, an ""invariant measure"" on the parameter space.",['Edwin T.

"The problem considered is that of obtaining solutions to large nonlinear mathematical programs by coordinated solution of smaller subproblems. If all functions in the original problem are additively separable, this can be done by finding a saddle point for the associated Lagrangian function. Coordination is then accomplished by shadow prices, with these prices chosen to solve a dual program. Characteristics of the dual program are investigated, and an algorithm is proposed in which subproblems are solved for given shadow prices. These solutions provide the value and gradient of the dual function, and this information is used to update the shadow prices so that the dual problem is brought closer to solution.

"Abstract—Finding simple or ""canonical representations"" for regular events is one of the important problems concerning finite automata. The present paper is an attempt to find concatenative canonical decompositions for regular events. Five different decomposition types of regular events are defined, imustrated by examples, and their properties investigated. The main tool in our investigations is the notion of a decomposition set; it is a generalization of the notion of a decomposition state, introduced by the authors in a previous paper. [7] Let A =(S, M, s 0 , F) be a finite automaton; a subset S̄⊂S is a decomposition set if A goes through a state of S̄ whenever it accepts a tape. In order to determine whether a given subset S̄⊂S is a decomposition set one has to check only tapes whose length is not greater than |S|-|S̄|-1, where |S| and |S̄| are the number of states in S and S̄, respectively. Thus, one can deternine all decomposition sets of A. The knowledge of the decomposition sets of A enables one to determine whether and in what form T(A), the set of tapes accepted by A, is decomposable.","['Azaria Paz', 'Bezalel Peleg']",50,"['3a886d3f-9c4f-4874-93ee-1e4d4d448326', '6b7490b5-7609-43d0-a3d4-0660ce08a1d2', '70e19a57-78b6-4c5e-bce8-d1ceb1244bdf', '852f8160-8e98-4b24-8c03-2136b3d2bce7', 'b0f6455a-6f99-42c5-8502-4fa535768ceb', 'bdb1e272-30ca-44c3-92f4-390585e4d698', 'e7cd0643-7ea2-4385-b95c-5301e8cddd4b', 'ebb5ad03-c65b-403d-89d1-c4fb514ba43d']",On Concatenative Decompositions of Regular Events,IEEE Transactions on Computers,1968,e09c76f3-d5d6-4b6d-a650-8723f84d0bc1

"Not all switching functions are realizable by a single cascade of 2- input, 1-output switching elements, even if repeated inputs are allowed. However, arrays of such cascades feeding a single collector cascade of AND or OR cells can be used to synthesize any function. This paper is concerned with optimal array realizations of this form. A procedure is given which allows one to generate rather efficiently all prime cascade realizable functions which imply a given switching function. These prime functions may be restricted to those realizable by a single cascade either with or without repeated inputs. To solve problems of optimal single output array synthesis, allowing incompletely specified functions, it is necessary only to select a minimum cost cover from the set of prime cascade realizable functions.

"The control of large military forces is creating the need for large data-processing systems located in transport aircraft and in other situations where tight quarters and hostile environments call for the design features found in airborne systems. In these applications the configuration of the computer and its peripheral equipment strongly resembles what is found in a typical commercial data-processing system, with some additional requirements for reliability. In particular, the functional programs are complex and extensive, and the availability of a complete package of support software, including compilers and utility routines as well as the resident executive, is likely to be of critical importance. Because of its cost, so complete a software package cannot reasonably be developed specifically to answer a particular military need; it must be captured from an existing software system.

In this nebulous group we include professional economists, political scientists, psychologists, sociologists, and a large number of university students in those disciplines. An important assumption underlying our work has been that the cost of not having substantially better software than presently exists is very large and should be measured in terms of researchers' time. The true cost of inappropriate methods of computer utilization should not be measured by staff and computer costs, but by the social cost of the output foregone.

"Compiler-writing techniques have received a great deal of pragmatic and academic attention and are now fairly well-defined. It was and still is generally felt that the compiler is independent of the operating system in which it resides, if it resides in one at all. The invention of time-sharing systems with conversational capability, however, has required that compiler experts re-evaluate existing concepts to make better use of external facilities. This was done and conversational and incremental compilers have evolved. A generalized and consolidated discussion of these relatively new concepts is the subject of this paper. First, a model of a batch compiler is introduced. The concepts are then modified and extended for a conversational programming environment. Finally, a recent development termed ""incremental"" compilation, which satisfies the needs of both batch and conversational compiling as well as interactive computing, is presented.

The resultant classifier is in the form of a layered machine which is composed of multithreshold elements.

While the choice of which classes of transgeneration units to consider is ultimately up to the user, a number of such units are suggested herein. The algorithm gives an indication as to the effectiveness of various transgeneration units and hence can also be used in an interactive manner if so desired for the actual design of a classification structure.","['G Ernest Henrichon', 'King-Sun Fu']",146,"['31ded88c-67a0-41eb-848d-578dba76fc42', '522e1bb9-8ec7-448b-a6ea-7e08b3b6b205', '5880d47f-8b99-416d-a743-28d6b49f7ba9', '96be72ed-1a03-4302-9b82-ad2321c4bbd3']",A Nonparametric Partitioning Procedure for Pattern Classification,IEEE Transactions on Computers,1969,9f0e6b3f-d06a-4e99-936d-0d386bffadca

"In the spring of 1967 Washington State University began investigating the possibility of replacing or supplementing its IBM 2702 terminal control unit with a small computer. We hoped to realize four significant advantages from such a move:   1. A small computer---being programmable---offered the opportunity of increased flexibility in the control of remote terminals.   2. The prices of small computers had decreased to the point that it seemed reasonable to expect such a system to cost less than the IBM 2702.   3. Since IBM required that each TTY line be connected to the 2702 via a 3233 line adapter and a 103A or 103F data set, we felt that significant savings might be obtained through lower incremental costs per line, achieved by providing either direct TTY connection or the use of lower cost data sets on leased private lines.   4. By handling as many communication problems as possible in the small computer, we hoped to reduce substantially the amount and complexity of system modifications in the large computer.","['H.B.

"The Teachable Language Comprehender (TLC) is a program designed to be capable of being taught to “comprehend” English text. When text which the program has not seen before is input to it, it comprehends that text by correctly relating each (explicit or implicit) assertion of the new text to a large memory. This memory is a “semantic network” representing factual assertions about the world.  The program also creates copies of the parts of its memory which have been found to relate to the new text, adapting and combining these copies to represent the meaning of the new text. By this means, the meaning of all text the program successfully comprehends is encoded into the same format as that of the memory. In this form it can be added into the memory.  Both factual assertions for the memory and the  capabilities  for correctly relating text to the memory's prior content are to be taught to the program as they are needed. TLC presently contains a relatively small number of examples of such assertions and capabilities, but within the system, notations for expressing either of these are provided. Thus the program now corresponds to a general process for comprehending language, and it provides a methodology for adding the additional information this process requires to actually comprehend text of any particular kind.  The memory structure and comprehension process of TLC allow new factual assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions to generalize automatically. That is, once such an assertion or capability is put into the system, it becomes available to help comprehend a great many other sentences in the future. Thus the addition of a single factual assertion or linguistic capability will often provide a large increment in TLC's effective knowledge of the world and in its overall ability to comprehend text.

"In this paper we consider the problem of deriving upper bounds on the number of state variables required for an n-state universal asynchronous state assignment (i.e., a state assignment which is valid for any n-state asynchronous sequential function). We will consider a special class of state assignments called SST assignments which were first derived by Liu [1] and later extended by Tracey [2]. In these assignments all variables which must change in a given transition are allowed to change simultaneously without critical races. The best universal bound known so far has been developed by Liu and requires 2so-1 state variables, where S0 = [log2n], n being the number of states, and [x] being the least integer > x. We shall show how this bound can be substantially improved. We further show that, by generalizing the state assignment to allow multiple codings for states, the bounds can be still further improved.","['Arthur D. Friedman', 'Ronald L. Graham', 'Jeffrey D.

"In a time-sharing system that is intended to serve a number of console users simultaneously, there are two related, but distinct, functions to be performed. One is  time slicing , which is the allocation of bursts of processor time to the various active programs according to a suitable algorithm. The other is  core space allocation  which arises because, in a modern multi-programmed system, there will be space in core for more than one active program at the same time. If, as will normally be the case, there are more active programs than can be accommodated in core, some of them must be held on a drum and brought into core periodically; this is  swapping . Confusion has sometimes arisen between time slicing and swapping, since, in the early time-sharing systems, there was only one active object program resident in core at any time, all the others being on the drum. In these circumstances, swapping and time slicing go together; when a program is in core, it is receiving processor time, and as soon as it ceases to receive processor time it is removed from core. In a multi-programmed system, however, space allocation and time slicing can proceed independently. It is the responsibility of the space allocation algorithm to ensure that, as far as possible, there is always at least one program in core that is ready to run. The time-slicing algorithm is responsible for dividing up the available processor time between the various programs that are in core.",['Maurice V.

"An affirmative partial answer is provided to the question of whether it is possible to program parallel-processor computing systems to efficiently decrease execution time for useful problems. Parallel-processor systems are multiprocessor systems in which several of the processors can simultaneously execute separate tasks of a single job, thus cooperating to decrease the solution time of a computational problem. The processors have independent instruction counters, meaning that each processor executes its own task program relatively independently of the other processors. Communication between cooperating processors is by means of data in storage shared by all processors.   A program for the determination of the distribution of current in an electrical network was written for a parallel-processor computing system, and execution of this program was simulated. The data gathered from simulation runs demonstrate the efficient solution of this problem, typical of a large class of important problems. It is shown that, with proper programming, solution time when  N P   processors are applied approaches 1/ N P   times the solution time for a single processor, while improper programming can actually lead to an increase of solution time with the number of processors. Storage interference and other measures of performance are discussed. Stability of the method of solution was also investigated.",['Jack L.

"A procedure for the optimum detection of stochastic signals in noise is discussed. The optimum test function is expanded in a point-wise convergent series for which a bound on the convergence properties can be obtained. Knowledge of this bound permits the substitution of a truncated version of the series for the optimum test function. This leads to a test procedure that uses a variable number of terms of the series for each decision and also gives the same decision as the optimum detector. For detection of stochastic signals in Gaussian noise, an expansion is obtained in terms of the eigenfunctions associated with the Gaussian probability density function, which leads to optimum decisions with a moderate number of terms of the series. It is also well suited for adaptive detection in which the distribution function of the stochastic signal is unknown--the coefficients of the expansion factor into two terms, one dependent only on the noise distribution and the other dependent on the distribution of the stochastic signal. Computer results for Gaussian noise are given. For this case, the test procedure can be viewed as a sequence of linear, quadratic, etc., detectors that, when a basic inequality is met, terminates with an optimum decision.",['Stuart C.

"A. N. Prior in [9] has suggested an approach towards a second order logic of existence where, following medieval logicians, we distinguish ""between predicates (like 'is red', 'is hard', etc.) which entail existence, and predicates (like 'is thought to be red', 'is thought of', etc.) which do not.""2 Let us refer to attributes (including relational attributes) which are designated by the former kind of predicate as existence attributes, or for brevity, e-attributes. It is suggested then that 'x exists' be defined as 'there is some e-attribute which x possesses'. In what follows, this approach regarding the concept of existence is formalized semantically as well as syntactically, and a completeness theorem is established corresponding to the completeness (in a secondary sense, i.e., as including normal, nonstandard models) of standard second order logic (as formulated, for example, in Church [1]). In [2] (cf. the abstracts [3] and [4]), the present author formalized a complete first order logic (with identity) of actual and possible objects which was there used in the formulation of a complete first order tense logic.3 The observation, which will be proved here, was made by Prior that in a second order logic with e-attributes quantification over actual objects can be appropriately defined so that every theorem of the first order logic of actual and possible objects becomes a theorem of second order logic with e-attributes.4 In effect, the definition (where q is a formula, a is an individual variable, and vr is a 1-place predicate variable) is e e",['Nino B.

"A method of solving Fredholm integral equations by state-variable techniques is presented. A principal feature of this method is that it leads to efficient computer algorithms for calculating numerical solutions. The assumptions made are 1) the kernel of the integral equation is the covariance function of a random process, 2) this random process is the output of a linear system having a white-noise input, 3) this linear system has a finite-dimensional state-variable description. Both the homogeneous and inhomogeneous equations are reduced to two linear first-order differential equations and an associated set of boundary conditions. The coefficients of these differential equations and the boundary conditions are specified directly by the matrices describing the random process that generates the kernel. The eigenvalues of the homogeneous integral equation are found to be solutions of a transcendental equation involving the transition matrix of the vector differential equations. The eigenfunctions follow directly. By using this same transcendental equation, an effective method of calculating the Fredholm determinant is derived. For the inhomogeneous equation, the vector differential equations are identical to those obtained in the state-variable formulation of the optimal linear smoother.

"This paper describes a system for information storage, retrieval, and updating, with special attention to the search algorithm and data structure demanded for maximum program efficieny. The program efficiency is especially warranted when a natural language or a symbolic language is involved in the searching process.The system is a basic framework for an efficient information system. It can be implemented for text processing and document retrieval; numerical data retrieval; and for handling of large files such as dictionaries, catalogs, and personnel records, as well as graphic informations. Currently, eight commands are implemented and operational in batch mode on a CDC 3600: STORE, RETRIEVE, ADD, DELETE, REPLACE, PRINT, COMPRESS and LIST. Further development will be on the use of teletype console, CRT terminal, and plotter under a time-sharing environment for producing immediate responses.The maximum program efficiency is obtained through a unique search algorithm and data structure. Instead of examining the recall ratio and the precision ratio at a higher level, this efficiency is measured in the most basic term of ""average number of searches"" required for looking up an item. In order to identify an item, at least one search is necessary even if it is found the first time. However, through the use of the hash-address of a key or keyword, in conjunction with an indirect-chaining list-structured table, and a large available space list, the average number of searches required for retrieving a certain item is 1.25 regardless of the size of the file in question.

"If a mathematical model of a signal detection problem is such that there exists a detector which achieves zero error, the model is called singular. Such models are usually not acceptable. In this paper, various sufficient conditions for singular detection and estimation are presented. For the case of a known signal, second-moment conditions are given which imply singularity of detection in the most general kind of noise. For the case of random signals, no such general result exists. Let the signal be a known function of some random parameter s(t; \gamma(\omega)) and let the detection problem corresponding to each value of \gamma(\omega) be singular. It is shown that if \gamma(\omega) has a discrete distribution or if the noise n(t) is Gaussian, then detection is singular. Finally, if n(t) is wide-sense stationary, if the signal is the sum of randomly spaced Fourier transformable signals, and if certain moment conditions are satisfied, then one can not only singularly detect the signal, but can also singularly estimate the unknown parameters of the signal--at least when n(t) is Gaussian.",['Percy A.

The extremum of the energy ratio depends only on the nonzero characteristic numbers of the correlation matrix of rank r and on the first r characteristic numbers of a kernel related to the filter used in the bandwidth definition. The optimum signal waveforms also depend on the characteristic vectors of the correlation matrix and are given by linear sums of the first r characteristic functions of the kernel.

"Optimal control theory concepts are thought to be useful in understanding the problem of determining safe deceleration characteristics for a crashing vehicle. These deceleration waveforms are to be computed such that passenger belt forces are minimized. Using both a linear one-degree-of-freedom model and a nonlinear two-degree-of-freedom model for a frontal collision, this problem is shown to be equivalent to the minimization of a performance or cost function when the terminal time is not fixed a priori, but is determined by terminal constraints. While the maximum principle is applied directly to find the optimal deceleration waveform for the linear problem, the steepest ascent method is used to optimize iteratively the nonlinear problem. Passenger seatbelt forces which resulted from using these optimal waveforms were compared with those forces which resulted from using step and ramp functions. Results showed that the seat belt forces resulting from the optimally derived deceleration signals were considerably smaller than those using step and ramp functions. With further effort, these results could possibly be used as design guides.","['Kaufman Hi', 'D.

"The use of systems of secret communications as an economical method to increase the security of confidential computerized files has stimulated much interest.

Today, one finds the very nature of computerized information systems actually facilitates its unlawful reproduction and transmission to anyone with the tools and know-how. Unlike information which is stored with scrambling techniques, information stored in clear form requires no sophisticated technology, nor complex deciphering systems for either decoding or dissemination. More importantly, there is good reason to assume that organized crime and industrial spies have, or will have, the knowledge and the financial resources necessary to acquire and misuse the information in most systems now being considered, including the tapping of communication lines.

"An on-line software checkout facility for special purpose computers (referred to as the Flight Software Development Laboratory) has been created to aid programmer/engineers in the development of programs that will operate in a spaceborne computer aboard the Apollo/Saturn IB and V Launch Vehicles. The Flight Computer operates as an integral part of various vehicle subsystems in the Instrument Unit (IU). The subsystems provide onboard navigation, guidance, control, sequencing, data compression, and ground communications. These functions are illustrated in Figure 1. Continued emphasis is placed on error-free flight software, since it is an essential element in overall vehicle performance. No opportunity exists to test or exercise the flight program in its actual flight environment prior to a mission.

"In this paper, we have introduced a new style of formal grammars called String Adjunct Grammars (AG). The rules in an AG have a considerably different formal character as compared to the 'rewrite rule' in a Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG). Such a study of formal grammars of different styles (i.e., formal character of rules) is of great interest because each style is well suited for characterizing certain aspects of natural language structure and is awkward for characterizing certain other aspects. Several subclasses of AG's motivated by strong linguistic considerations have been studied, comparing them with PSG's. Linguistic relevance of these grammars (and other gram mars suggested by this study) has been discussed at the end.","['Aravind K. Joshi', 'S.R. Kosaraju', 'H.M.

Using the resultant minimum variance plant model, experimental closed-loop responses of the human accommodative system are predicted by synthesizing the system closed-loop controller. The resultant control signals are shown to minimize the time required to change the refractive state of the eye. The plant dynamic model and the closed-loop model are further verified by comparing their frequency responses to experimental data.

Thus the sequential form of the optimum linear feedback code with an average power constraint on the transmitter is derived for noiseless feedback but forward noise of arbitrary covariance.

"System performance tests have recently been carried out on an experimental electrochemically active/plastic system designed to demonstrate and begin to explore the theoretically predicted phenomenon we call temporally associative ""field-trainability,"" a process which, when perfected and extended, may lead to revolutionary advances in manufacturing ultrahigh-density and highly versatile pattern recognition machines. The first complete experimental system, called-linear field-trainable, (LIFT) consists of two matching but opposing (excitatory/inhibitory) parallel arrays of active/plastic dipoles (iron/gold) in nitric acid, which are stimulated (electrically) in various patterns of activity. and respond by simple parallel coupling through the surrounding fluids and steel container walls to a low-impedance low-pass threshold detector. Alternatively, when desired, the chambers are connected to a power supply, the effect of which is to deliver massive electrical shocks to the entire array at once. The resulting reinforcement field is applied in synchronism with sample input pattern stimulations (which alternate with unreinforced response test stimulations) in attempts to induce at will, in a sequence of small steps, simultaneous changes of fine cellular structure which will produce corresponding specific systemic functional mutations as desired from among the class of linear decision functions.",['Robert M.

In other words, we are interested in the partially ordered structure ≪ ΣΦ,⊆ ≫ where ΣΦ = {Rt( )Φ|t( ) is recursive} is called the family of Φ-complexity classes. Of special interest is the subfamily ΩΦ = {RΦi( )Φ | Φi( ) is total}, called the family of exact Φ-complexity classes. We show that ΣL and ΩL are dense under ⊂ for sufficiently large bounds t( ), but ΩL is not dense in ΣL. We also construct measures Φ for which ΣΦ and ΩΦ are non-dense, for which ΣΦ is dense but ΩΦ is not, for which ΩΦ is dense but ΣΦ is not and for which ΩΦ is dense in ΣΦ.

"A recursive Bayes optimal solution is found for the problem of sequential multicategory pattern recognition when unsupervised learning is required. An unknown parameter model is developed which, for the pattern classification problem, allows for 1) both constant and time-varying unknown parameters, 2) partially unknown probability laws of the hypotheses and time-varying parameter sequences, 3) dependence of the observations on past as well as present hypotheses and parameters, and most significantly, 4) sequential dependencies in the observations arising from either (or both) dependency in the pattern or information source (context dependence) or in the observation medium (sequential measurement correlation), these dependencies being up to any finite Markov orders. For finite parameter spaces, the solution which is Bayes optimal (minimum risk) at each step is found and shown to be realizable in recursive form with fixed memory requirements. The asymptotic properties of the optimal solution are studied and conditions established for the solution (in addition to making best use of available data at each step) to converge in performance to operation with knowledge of the (unobservable) constant unknown parameters.","['Charles G.

"The deflection of a bounded quadratic-linear test statistic is considered for the following binary detection problem. Hypothesis H_{1} --received waveform is a sample function from a random process with known covariance and mean functions, but unknown probability distributions, versus H_{2} --received waveform is a sample function from a Gaussian process (noise) having known covariance and mean functions. Sample functions are assumed to belong to a real and separable Hilbert space. The test statistic is assumed to be the sum of a bounded quadratic operation and a bounded linear operation on the data. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the deflection to be bounded over all non-null bounded quadratic-linear operations are given, and additional results are obtained under the assumption that the deflection is bounded. Several relations are shown to exist between the deflection problem and the optimum discrimination problem when both processes are Gaussian. In particular, it is shown that nonsingular discrimination occurs if and only if a generalized deflection is bounded, and that in some cases the problem of realizing the log-likelihood ratio is equivalent to the problem of attaining the least upper bound for the deflection.",['Charles R.

"The utility of associative memory in a wide variety of information handling systems has been long recognized and in the early 1950's such memory systems were proposed for implementation through cryotron logic and storage arrays. Cryogenic element technology afforded the ingredient of compatible logic and memory within a basic cell, a requirement essential to the practical realization of associative memories. To date, such an approach has not been successful due mainly to processing difficulties connected with thin film elements operating in a liquid helium environment. Other approaches, involving the use of multi-apertured magnetic elements, have been proposed and implemented, but the resultant cost was prohibitive due to complexities of peripheral electronics as well as the magnetic storage element itself. Furthermore, systems of this type have relatively long parallel search times (~ 10 μsecs) especially if access is on a serial-by-bit basis. These considerations have seriously limited the applicability of associative concepts in all forms of data processing and have resulted in a situation where system designers do not consider associative memory as a solution to a given problem in spite of many obvious advantages in applications such as sorting, merging, pattern recognition, and most recently, memory allocation in time shared computers.","['Joseph R.

"Three years ago at the Solid-State Circuits Conference in Philadelphia, the concept of large-scale integration was already considered to be sufficiently far advanced as to be the main theme of the Conference, with a large number of technical papers showing beautiful colored slides of potential ""products,"" containing several hundred transistors interconnected with two layers of metallization on a single chip of silicon. Related papers were presented at the Fall Joint Computer Conference that year, and semiconductor vendors had, for some time, been indicating the benefits that would accrue to the straightforward extension of the principles of planar integrated circuits to more complex ""subsystems"" on a single piece of silicon. The concept appeared to be clear---all that remained was its implementation; yet, as of the start of 1969, no major systems had been constructed with LSI and predictions of significant volume usage were still one to two years away.

"An ""asynchronous unit delay"" is an n-input n-output asynchronous sequential circuit in which the present value of the output n-tuple is equal to the value of input n-tuple prior to the last input change. In this paper it is shown that such a circuit can be used as a basic building block in the design of any asynchronous circuit. It is shown that any fundamental mode flow table is realizable by a circuit of feedback index m with one asynchronous unit delay, m inertial delays, and a combinational network, where m is the smallest integer ≥ {log2 max (Si)} and Si is the number of stable states in any input column of the table. A straightforward method of realizing ""asynchronous indefinite"" fundamental mode tables without critical races by circuits of feedback index 1 with k asynchronous unit delays, one inertial delay, and combinational gates is also suggested.

"State-of-the-art advances---in particular, anticipated advances generated by LSI---have given fresh impetus to research in the area of parallel processing. The motives for parallel processing include the following:   1. Real-time urgency. Parallel processing can increase the speed of computation beyond the limit imposed by technological limitations.   2. Reduction of turnaround time of high priority jobs.   3. Reduction of memory and time requirements for ""housekeeping"" chores. The simultaneous but properly interlocked operations of reading inputs into memory and error checking and editing can reduce the need for large intermediate storages or costly transfers between members in a storage hierarchy.   4. An increase in simultaneous service to many users. In the field of the computer utility, for example, periods of peak demand are difficult to predict. The availability of spare processors enables an installation to minimize the effects of these peak periods. In addition, in the event of a system failure, faster computational speeds permit service to be provided to more users before the failure occurs.   5. Improved performance in a uniprocessor multi-programmed environment. Even in a uniprocessor environment, parallel processable segments of high priority jobs can be overlapped so that when one segment is waiting for I/O, the processor can be computing its companion segment. Thus an overall speed up in execution is achieved.","['C. V.

"Recent advances in man-machine communication have stimulated increased interest in techniques and special circuits that generate characters, for graphical and alphanumeric Cathode-Ray-Tube (CRT) display terminals, at the display site. The primary advantage in employing such local character generation is compression of the data that is required to store and communicate a character from the computer to the display---a single binary word of length n is all that is required to instruct the character generator to display one of 2  n   possible characters. The primary disadvantage of local character generation is display cost, for it is generally considerably less expensive to generate characters from a longer sequence of more elementary commands---for example commands that cause the CRT beam to move right, left, up or down by a minimum resolvable increment. Besides these conflicting costs of data storage and transmission versus local-display generation, several other less tangible criteria such as character stability and fidelity (aesthetics), are instrumental in the design and evaluation of a local character-generation approach.",['Michael L.

"The TX-2 computer, an experimental machine at the M.I.T. Lincoln Laboratory, has been in operation for almost 10 years as an on-line, graphically oriented facility. In 1964, a time-sharing system for the TX-2 was started. This system, APEX, was to service a small number of consoles with graphic display capability. To achieve hardware economy, displays were to be refreshed from main core memory through a time-shared vector generator providing analog signals distributed to the individual console scopes. The displays were to be refreshed directly from a structured display file as experience with the Sketchpad developments of the early 1960's had indicated was highly desirable for interactive graphic applications. Although the APEX graphic system has evolved through several generations of display hardware and corresponding software changes, the initial design principles of displays refreshed from structured information in main core by a time-shared generator have remained.

"This paper discusses a new line-routing algorithm. The algorithm has been programmed in FORTRAN II for the IBM 7094 and in FORTRAN IV for the IBM 360/65. It has given good results when applied to many line-routing problems such as mazes, printed circuit boards, substrates, and PERT diagrams. The main advantages of this algorithm, which is based on the continuous plane, over conventional algorithms based on the discrete plane are twofold:   1. Since the algorithm is based on the continuous plane, there is theoretically no limit to the degree of precision used to describe the position of points. In practice, the only factor restricting the precision is the magnitude of the largest (or smallest) number which may be stored in a computer. As a result, the nodes on a printed circuit board, for example, can be input with mil accuracy. If this feat were to be accomplished by existing methods on a 9×9 inch board, a matrix of 81,000,000 cells would have to be stored (and searched) in the computer.   2. The algorithm stores only line segments; therefore to find a path, only the segments that are currently defined need be investigated. Usually with conventional methods, every cell that lies on every possible minimal path must be investigated. The net result is that this algorithm is much faster than the conventional method.",['David W.

A graph model of computer programs has been developed in a series of studies directed toward improving analysis of the structure of programs executed on different computer configurations. One inherent weakness of the model has been the need for estimates of the mean number of times a program would cycle around its loop structures and estimates of branching probabilities. Extensive improvements were made in the model on the assumption that good estimates would be inserted during a manual transformation of a given program into a computer processable graph representation. The combination of improved tools for measurement of program activities and recently developed analysis programs now permit automatic analysis of source programs. The automatic analysis is based on more reliable measured a priori statistics. This paper discusses a valuable by-product of this measurement and analysis which directs attention toward those parts of a program which are leading candidates for application of optimization techniques. In particular we present an example of the automatic analysis of programs written in the FORTRAN IV language.

"The foundations of a ""constraint theory"" whose goal is the systematic analysis of consistency and computability in heterogeneous mathematical models of very high dimension were established in a previous paper [1]. The eventual objective of this theory is to automate the automatic determination of whether a complex mathematical model and its required computations are ""well posed."" This part concentrates on the topological properties of the bipartite model graph defined in [1] and the application of these properties to the location of intrinsic constraint in large mathematical models composed of ""regular"" relations. In particular, the model graph concepts of connected components, trees, circuits, circuit rank, circuit index, and constraint potential are defined with sufficient precision to allow automatic computation. Regular relations, the most commonly employed for scientific models, are defined and the sources of constraint are identified with the ""basic nodal square,"" a special subgraph embedded within the total model graph. A procedure is then developed which uses the topological properties developed earlier to locate the basic nodal squares within a large complex model graph. The ultimate use of the sources of intrinsic constraint is to check the consistency of the model and the allowability of the computations put to it.","['George J. Friedman', 'Cornelius T.

"The purpose of this paper is to develop an analytic foundation for the determination of whether a mathematical model and its desired computations are ""well-posed"" in order to help alleviate the software problems associated with the simulation of complex large-scale systems by heterogeneous mathematical models involving several hundred dimensions. The problem is approached by providing a rigorous basis for the commonplace notion of constraint. Four distinct viewpoints of the mathematical model are established: 1) the set theoretic relation space; 2) the family of submodels; 3) the bipartite graph, which provides topological insight; and 4) the constraint matrix. Fundamental definitions of mathematical model consistency, computational allowability, and extrinsic and intrinsic constraint are established on a set theory basis. Correspondences are proved between the topological properties of a model's graph and its constraint properties. Variables located in different connected components of a graph are always mutually consistent, but computations performed on them are never allowable. If a model graph of universal relations has a tree structure, then all its variables are mutually consistent. Detailed treatment of special relation classes will be given in Parts II and III.","['George J. Friedman', 'Cornelius T.

"A survey of the literature related to man-computer interaction reveals the many aspects of this problem, which appears to be in the crossroads among such diverse fields as computer languages, computer systems operational characteristics, control theory, decision theory, information theory, applied psychology, computer display and interface engineering, etc. In this paper we have chosen to present the on-line interaction from an information and decision point of view. After a brief discussion of classes of on-line situations and tasks, we propose an information-processing model of the case in which a human operator is engaged on-line in the solution of a problem like debugging a program, testing a model in a scientific application, or performing a library search. In this model the human operator is considered to seek to maximize overall cost. This cost is obtained by adding the operational cost of both man and computer to a remnant terminal cost originated by the remaining uncertainty. This analysis, performed for each of a set of possible alternatives for action, may lead the man to select and execute one of them, to terminate the process, or to reevaluate the possible alternatives and/or hypotheses in a search for new ones. Some practical applications in terms of response time and other characteristics of a computer utility are discussed, as well as some theoretical implications from an informational point of view.",['Jaim \\ Ie R.

"There are grounds for questioning whether translation done by computer should resemble closely, either in process or in product, translation done manually. Several workers in machine translation have proposed radical departures from the naively adopted goal of simulating manual translation mechanically. Because they saw a similarity between their mechanically feasible output and the pidgin languages that saw a similarity between their mechanically feasible output and the pidgin languages that have arisen naturally in some parts of the world, they dubbed their proposals 'pidgin translation'.This paper explores a more rigorous approach, which may be described as follows: texts in one language are encoded into words and other morphs taken from a second language, but this is done  without disturbing the syntax  of the source language. The term 'transcoding' is coined to denote that process. Transcoding results in a product in many ways similar to earlier types of pidgin translation (and incidentally more like natural pidgin languages than the latter were), but is founded on the principle that no information-bearing elements at all may be lost in the process. This principle is embodied in two strict guidelines:1. Each and every grammatical morph in the original must be reproduced in the transcoded text by a code morph; the linear order of elements is not to be changed.2. The transcoding dictionary (the codebook) must be so constructed as to preserve all the lexical contrasts inherent in the source vocabulary.These guidelines are investigated and supplemented, and their effects are predicted with regard to (1) the output, (2) the user's ability to interpret transcoded material and to learn to interpret it better, (3) the possibility of employing transcoding to make rough drafts for the human professionals in translation agencies to revise.Sample passages of transcoded Arabic and transcoded Chinese are presented, following which some comparisons are made between transcoding and pidgin translation, machine translation as practised or envisioned, and manual translation.","['Theo Hofmann', 'Brian Harris']",0,,Machine transcoding,international conference on computational linguistics,1969,f3db1748-6baf-4c4d-9c25-738973f03cf3
"The automata roots of path sensitizing fault diagnosis are discussed. It is demonstrated that the path sensitizing diagnosis method is equivalent to a Moore type ""machine identification"" experiment for a machine class which contains good and faulty copies of a transmission path submachine of a complete machine. The maximum length of a complete set of path sensitizing tests for a machine is proporational to n, the number of states in the complete machine, rather than n2 as required by direct use of the Moore ""machine identification"" method without partitioning of the complete machine into a set of submachines. For memoryless irredundant machines the fault resolution power of a complete set of path sensitizing tests is, nevertheless, the maximum which is possible if no submachine with a fault is used as a sensitizing vehicle. The use of the path sensitizing method in irredundant sequential machines with memory, on the other hand, may not yield the maximum fault resolution power since those faults which have been grouped together in the faulty copy of a particular transmission path submachine may be distinguishable from each other.",['Thomas A.

"This paper describes procedures to process part of the information affecting decisions about unmanned exploration of the solar system. Since direct iteration between analysts and several levels of decision makers is, at best, a slow process, we have attempted to design the results of the analysis so that such iteration will not be necessary. In particular, we have avoided attempting to encode decision makers' judgments of probabilities or relative worths, relying instead on the technical judgments of technical experts in their areas of competence. Specifically, the contributions of proposed sequences of unmanned missions toward achieving the primary scientific objectives of exploring the solar system are determined. Consideration of the relative worths of these objectives, however, is left to the decision makers. Risks and uncertainties are explicitly considered, and results are depicted by probability contours. The utilization of resources-funding and manpower-is estimated and displayed. However, decisions cannot be made solely on the basis of the information processed with these procedures. Hence, mission sequences that the procedures indicate are less than optimal are retained. Since portions of the scientific objectives may be fulfilled or preempted by the space exploration programs of other nations, several foreign space programs are assumed as background to provide further insight into the wisdom of alternative decisions.","['R.

"Dynostat is the name given to a system optimization technique employing both instantaneous and predictive optimum seeking strategies in parallel. Although it has both off-line and on-line capabilities of application this account is concerned mainly with an explanation of the essentials of the technique in the context of off-line optimization studies. A brief description of a successful application study of a practical problem in industry is also included. The technique is explained in a progressive manner by considering an example for which there is a requirement for an optimum schedule of alternative energy sources. As is well known, optimum scheduling using the dynamic programming technique is restricted in practice by limitations in computer storage and computing time to systems with few independent variables. However, in certain classes of multichannel systems some of these variables appear naturally, or by reasonable approximation can be made to appear, in a static section of the system, and it is shown that optimizing their values need consume only little computer time and storage. The remainder of the variables are in the dynamic section and their optimization makes a heavy demand on computational facilities. The Dynostat technique handles both types of variables in a single computer algorithm. An indication of a projected on-line configuration of Dynostat is presented in a statement of developments of the technique currently under study.","['J. A. Gibson', 'Graham E.

"In many applications a Poisson shot noise (PSN) process is said to statistically ""represent"" its intensity process. In this paper an investigation is made of the relationship between a PSN process and its intensity, when the latter is a sample function of a continuous stochastic process. The difference of the moments and the mean-square difference between the two processes are examined. The continuity assumption on the intensity permits the development of a sequence of moment relationships in which the effect of the PSN parameters can be seen. The results simplify and afford some degree of physical interpretation when the component functions of the PSN are ""rectangular,"" or when the intensity process does not vary appreciably over their time width. An integral equation is derived that defines the component function that minimizes the mean-square difference between the two processes. It is shown that a ""degenerate"" form of component function induces complete statistical equality of the two processes.

"Automation of the design of computer logic has evoked wide-spread interest and activity. Nevertheless, detailed comparisons of automatically generated logic and manually prepared logic have not been made available.   The ALERT program is a logic generator which accepts as input a summary description of a new computer in a high-level language, and from this it compiles logic designs to carry out the functions specified. This paper examines the quality of logic generated by the ALERT system.   The specifications of several computers have been processed through the ALERT system. This report discusses the most comprehensive design processed, the central processor of the IBM 1800 computer.   The 1800 had been designed by conventional manual techniques prior to this study, and its logic schematics were, therefore, available for comparison with the logic generated by ALERT.   It was found that the automatically produced circuitry required 160% more components than used in the corresponding parts of the actual computer. Reasons for this discrepancy are considered, and methods are described which are expected to reduce the discrepancy between automatically generated designs and manual designs.   The study indicates that automatic generation of computer logic and circuitry from high-level system descriptions offers a practical and viable alternative to traditional methods of logic design.

An explanation is provided for the prevalence of apparently convergent relative frequencies in random sequences. The explanation is based upon the computational-complexity characterization of a random sequence. Apparent convergence is shown to be attributable to a surprising consequence of the selectivity with which relative frequency arguments are applied; it is a consequence of data handling rather than an underlying law or good fortune. The consequences of this understanding for probability and its applications are indicated.,['Terrence L.

"Rate distortion functions are calculated for time discrete and time continuous Wiener processes with respect to the mean squared error criterion.

In the time continuous case, we derive the explicit formula R(D) = 2 \sigma^2 / ( \pi^2 D) , where \sigma^2 is the variance of the increment daring a one-second interval. The resuiting R(D) curves are compared with the performance of an optimum integrating delta modulation system.

"An incremental language processor is one that accepts as input a sequence of substrings of the source language and maps them independently onto fragments in some object code. The ordered sequence of these object code fragments are then either compiled, in which case we have an incremental compiler, or interpreted. In the first case the advantage resulting is that subsequent changes in the source program entail only reprocessing the source fragments affected and recompiling the updated collection of object code fragments. In an environment where small changes are made frequently to large programs, e.g. debugging, the curtailment of reprocessing is attractive. In the second case the object code fragments are the actual run-time program representation, and hence inter-fragment relations are transiently evaluated as needed in the process of execution, with no long-term preservation of these relationships beyond the scope of their immediate need in execution time. This permits the possibility of program recomposition in the midst of execution, one of the principal characteristics of conversational computing.   Many conversational language processors execute a program representation functionally analogous to parse trees, i.e. the syntax analysis of a fragment, insofar as it is possible, is done at fragment load time. This representation choice is popular because many of the expensive aspects of interpretation, including character string scanning, symbol table lookup, and parsing, are performed once only and do not contribute to the execution overhead. This paper is devoted to examining the question of the construction of such a parser in a general manner for an arbitrary source language.",['Gary Lindstrom'],7,['3ec39d15-24c4-4794-85a7-07497e8641e2'],The design of parsers for incremental language processors,symposium on the theory of computing,1970,d9189baf-238f-4bbc-817a-16ff96669554

"A syntactic parser is described for hierarchical concatenation patterns that are presented to the analyzer in the form of linear strings. Particular emphasis is given to the system of “significant addresses” by means of which processing times for large-scale matching procedures can be substantially reduced. The description makes frequent use of examples taken from the fully operational implementation of the parser in an experimental English sentence analyzer.  By structuring an area of the computer's central core storage in such a way that the individual locations of bytes and bits come to represent the data involved in the matching procedure, the shifting of information is reduced to a minimum, and the searching of lists is eliminated altogether. The matches are traced by means of binary masks and the state of single bits determines the operational flow of the procedure.

Other production costs in the model are proportional to the quantity produced and expected inventory holding and penalty costs are convex. The cases treated include nonstationary finite horizon stationary infinite horizon, discounted cost, average cost, and excess demand being either backlogged or lost.

"In conventional digital differential analyzers (DDA), the word length used for the transmission of information between integrators is restricted to at most a single magnitude bit and a sign bit. This restriction seriously limits integrator frequency response and has to a large extent been responsible for the failure of DDAs to achieve widespread acceptance as general purpose differential analyzers. In this paper it is shown that DDA speed and accuracy can be greatly improved by using increment word lengths which are approximately one-half the length of integrand registers providing that integration formulas more accurate than Euler integration are used. The programming of such machines for the solution of both linear and nonlinear differential equations is discussed and a quantitative evaluation of performance improvement is presented. At the same time, an effort is made to isolate the principal difficulties in hardware implementation which result from extending the integrator increment resolution.","['Robert B. McGhee', 'Ragnar N.

"This paper describes an information storage and retrieval system called LISTAR (Lincoln Information Storage and Associative Retrieval) being implemented on Lincoln Laboratory's IBM 360/67 computer to run under the IBM CP/CMS time-sharing system. An experimental version of LISTAR designed to test its main features was implemented on the IBM 7094 under the MIT Compatible Time Sharing System (CTSS). This version was described in some detail in Lincoln Laboratory Technical Report 377. Because of its experimental nature, the CTSS version of LISTAR limited the total space for data files to the non-program space available in core memory. The current version allows the file space to extend beyond core memory to auxiliary storage. The logical limit of this space is determined by the addressing capacity of the system. File space size is currently fixed at 2 30  (1000 million) bytes. This could be increased by relatively minor program changes. The current version also introduces new techniques in space management to deal with this extended file space.","['Amedio W Armenti', 'S. W. Galley', 'R. Goldberg', 'James F. Nolan', 'A.

"A linear reinforcement learning technique is proposed to provide a memory and thus accelerate the convergence of successive approximation algorithms. The learning scheme is used to update weighting coefficients applied to the components of the correction terms of the algorithm. A direction of the search approaching the direction of a ""ridge"" will result in a gradient peak-seeking method which accelerates considerably the convergence to a neighborhood of the extremum. In a stochastic approximation algorithm the learning scheme provides the required memory to establish a consistent direction or search insensitive to perturbations introduced by the random variables involved. The accelerated algorithms and the respective proofs of convergence are presented. Illustrative examples demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithms.",['George N.

"Recent advances in integrated circuit technology and its potential advantage in logical design have motivated the search for modular synthesis techniques for logic networks. This problem may be divided into two parts: find appropriate modules; and develop efficient synthesis techniques for logic networks using a minimum number of modules. In this paper a new type of universal logic modules (ULM's) called the Q-type is presented. The Q-type ULM's are superior to the existing ULM's in the sense that they require fewer input/output terminals when n≥6 where n is the number of input variables of the ULM. Various techniques for synthesizing a logic network with a small number of ULM's are discussed. A much simpler type of modules, which is suitable to realize any symmetric or partially symmetric function and can be used as auxiliary building blocks for realizing any given logic function, is presented. A special kind of ULM's, called serially controlled ULM's which has only n+ 3 input/ output terminals, is also presented. For a ULM of this kind the signals for specifying the logic function to be realized are serially applied to one of its input terminals.","['Stephen S. Yau', 'Calvin K.

Such values of the factor a have the property that an approximate knowledge ofyi will not yield information about the successoryi+1.

Whereas a generalized version of Brown's theorem can be stated and proved relatively easily (as shown here), the one for Peterson's theorem is not forthcoming. However, we have succeeded in deriving a theorem for the ternary case (radix = 3) somewhat along the lines of the Peterson's theorem as follows. Let M_3 (A, d) denote the smallest positive integer such that the arithmetic weight of A M_3 (A, d) in ternary representation is less than d . Also ley A = 2p for some odd prime p .

"The template-layout problem is to determine how to cut irregular-shaped two-dimensional pieces out of given stock sheets in an optimum manner without making an exhaustive search of all possible arrangements of the pieces. An algorithm is described for solving template-layout problems with a digital computer. The method of solution requires that the irregular shapes be enclosed, singly or in combination, in minimum area rectangles called modules. Individual modules will contain from one to perhaps eight optimally fitted irregular pieces. The modules are then packed into the given stock sheet(s) so as to optimize a specified objective function. The packing is carried out with a dynamic programming algorithm, which converts the multivariable problem into a multistage one. Successive iterations of the algorithm are used to determine whether higher order modules (containing more irregular-shaped pieces) improve the solution. A detailed description of the algorithm is given. An illustrative example is included and its computer solution is described.

"As digital computing systems become more complex, diagnostic programs are being used more to detect and isolate failures in the logic system. One method of producing diagnostic programs which is receiving increased attention recently is automatic diagnostic program generation which has a logic simulator program as its central element. The simulator is effectively used if the viewpoint of Seshu and Freeman 1  on logic failures is adopted. This viewpoint says that a logic failure transforms a good machine into a different machine. Thus if there are N possible failures, there are N+1 different possible machines. The simulator is then used to test each of the N+1 machines. Testing is developed by following the method described by Bruli et al. 2  and is briefly outlined below.",['E.

However, even for moderate word length, the dictionary size can be quite large and prove a major obstacle in practical applications.

"A quantizer Q divides the range [0, 1] of a random variable x into K quantizing intervals the i th such interval having length \Delta x_i .

In this situation, the rate-distortion function R_a (d) is the minimum capacity required by any transmission system that can transmit each source from a with average distortion \leq d . One of the most interesting classes of sources is a class of random processes.

"Statistics conditioned on quantized measurements are considered in the general case. These results are specialized to Gaussian parameters and then extended to discrete-time linear systems. The conditional mean of the system's state vector may be found by passing the conditional mean of the measurement history through the Kalman filter that would be used had the measurements been linear. Repetitive use of Bayes' rule is not required. Because the implementation of this result requires lengthy numerical quadrature, two approximations are considered: the first is a power-series expansion of the probablity-density function; the second is a discrete-time version of a previously proposed algorithm that assumes the conditional distribution is normal. Both algorithms may be used with any memory length on stationary or nonstationary data. The two algorithms are applied to the noiseless-channel versions of the PCM, predictive quantization, and predictive-comparison data compression systems; ensemble-average performance estimates of the nonlinear filters are derived.

Under the assumptions of the model, the probability of graduation is shown to be the wth power of the conditional probability of successful completion of a unit of work, given that a student drops out or attends and successfully completes a unit of work.","['Kneale T.

"A probabilistic automaton with pattern recognition supervision is considered as an on-line real-time adaptive controller for a complex plant with a multimodal performance-index structure and subjected to an environment which randomly fluctuates in time. This environment is considered to be partially measurable but entirely uncontrollable. The automaton discussed is capable not only of learning the optimum control parameters in any given environmental situation but also of acting as an internal teacher in the formation of pattern associations between the measurable state of the environment and the control situation, so that approximately recurrent conditions can be taken advantage of in future relearning situations. These pattern associations, once developed, are used to supervise the future action of the automaton. Furthermore, the pattern associations between the measurable state of the environment and the control situation must themselves be adaptively formed to allow for variations caused by unknown and/or unmeasurable factors in the total environment.",['R.

If several input changes occur within some interval δ1, the circuit behaves as though the changes were simultaneous. If consecutive changes are spaced by intervals exceeding some longer interval δ2 then the circuit reacts as though a sequence of single changes had occurred. But when the spacing is between these values, the system may react in an unsatisfactory manner unless special attention is paid to the problem during the design process.

"A procedure for determining whether two graphs are isomorphic is described. During the procedure, from any given graph two graphs, the representative graph and the reordered graph, are derived. The representative graph is a homomorphic image of the original graph; the reordered graph is constructed from the representative graph to be isomorphic to the given graph. Unique labels are assigned to the vertices of both derived graphs. It follows that two repre- sentative graphs or two reordered graphs are isomorphic if and only if they are identical. A conjecture states that the representative graphs exhibit the automorphism partitioning of the given graph. The representative graphs form a necessity condition for isomorphism; namely, if the representative graphs are not identical, then the given graphs are not isomorphic. The converse is true for trees and follows from the conjecture for other types of graphs. It is also shown that the reordered graphs form a sufficiency condition for isomorphism; namely, if the reordered graphs are identical, then the given graphs are isomorphic. The converse follows from the conjecture. The time required to determine both derived graphs depends on a power of n, the order of the given graph. This power is a function of an adjacency property known as the strong regu- larity of the given graph. For graphs that do not contain a strongly regular transitive sub- graph, the power is, at worst, five.","['Derek G. Corneil', 'C. C.

"The object of this study is the analytic or computer-simulation model, used increasingly in analyses of combat, tactical and weapon-systems evaluation, etc. The thesis is that whenever the method yields quantitative results, it achieves these by setting the computer (or the analytic formulation) in states supposed to correspond to those in the combat, and programming a rule of transitions from state to state—picturing what is occurring in the combat. The transition rule may be deterministic or probabilistic, the latter usually by Monte Carlo selection; but the probabilities are always treated as known. This shows that the combat is assumed (explicitly or implicitly) to act as a stochastic process of the changes of state of a system. The computational procedure used implies further assumptions, which imply, in turn, that it is Markovian (directly, or after a transformation).

The tasks of generating moments and distributions of sums have been effectively executed in the Fourier spectrum. The properties of the Walsh-Hadamard transform of probability functions of discrete random variables is explored. Many analogies can be drawn between Fourier and Walsh analysis. In particular, it is shown that moments can be generated taking the Gibb's derivative of the Walsh spectrum and that products of Walsh spectra yield the distribution of dyadic sums.

A relation between parallel program schemata and finishing schemata is developed which allows one to carry over previous schemata results. Theorems describing closure properties and determinacy are then given for serial, concurrent and iterative composition of finishing schemata.","['W.A. Brinsfield', 'Raymond E.

"A machine representation of permanent memory faults is introduced where, if M is a sequential machine representing some fault free system, a memory fault is represented by a function μ on the states of M, and the result of the fault by an appropriately determined machine M μ . Given this representation, the investigation is primarily concerned with faults that are tolerated (masked) in the sense that resulting behavior relates in some specified way to original behavior. Several types of fault masking are thus considered and conditions for their existence investigated. The restriction to a special class of stable faults is also studied, this class being of interest since it includes all faults which correspond to ""stuck-at"" failures in the memory cells of a sequential switching network.",['John F.

"This paper defines a set of scheduling primitives which have evolved from multiprogramming systems described by Dijkstra, Lampson, Saltzer, and the present author. Compared to earlier papers on the same subject, the present one illustrates a more concise description of operating system principles by means of algorithms. This is achieved by (1) describing the primitives as the instructions of an abstract machine which in turn is defined by its instruction execution algorithm; (2) introducing a notation which distinguishes between the use of synchronizing variables (semaphores) to achieve mutual exclusion of critical sections, and to exchange signals between processes which have explicit input/output relationships; (3) considering the influence of critical sections on preemption and resumption; and (4) using a programming language, Pascal, which includes natural data types (records, classes, and pointers) for the representation of process descriptions and scheduling queues.

"Although the use of structured display files is widespread in interactive computer graphics, these structures present a number of problems which tend to restrict their generality and usefulness. This paper discusses some of these problems, and suggests an alternative approach to display system design which avoids the use of structured display files.  This technique employs display procedures to generate information for display. By including transformations within calls to these procedures it is possible both to simplify the specification of pictures and to speed up their generation. Display procedures permit picture elements to be defined conditionally and also facilitate the processing of inputs from pointing devices.

"The Delphi method is basically defined as a method for the systematic solicitation and collation of informed judgments on a particular topic. The concept of ""informed"" here could mean poor people, if the subject were poverty, as well as the usual interpretation of ""experts."" The method has two important characteristics which distinguish it considerably from a polling procedure. The first is  feedback , where the judgments of the individuals are collected, possibly formulated as a group response and fed back. Thus, each individual may view the results and consider whether he wishes to contribute more to the information and/or reconsider his earlier views. This round or phase structure may go through three to five iterations in the usual paper and pencil exercise. The second characteristic is that all responses are anonymous. The reasons for  anonymity  are much discussed in the literature and will not be reviewed here. However, there are circumstances where complete anonymity could be relaxed. In some cases it may be useful for the respondents to know who is participating in order to insure awareness that a peer group is involved in the discussion.

"Consider a stochastic system with output  Y  whose probability density  (pY \mid \Lambda)  is a known function of the parameter  \Lambda  whose true value is unknown. Our aim is to assign a prior probability density   b(\Lambda)  for  \Lambda  using all the available knowledge so that we can assess the probabilistic behavior of  Y  from the corresponding marginal density  q(Y) . Usually the range of  \Lambda  is known. In addition, by considering the distribution of  \Lambda  in similar systems, we can define the density  f(\Lambda) , about which we may have some knowledge such as  E(\Lambda _ 1 ^ {2}) \geq 1/2 , etc. We derive an expression for the uncertainty functional  \phi(\cdot)  involving  f(\Lambda)  and b(\Lambda)  to quantify the discrepancy between the actual behavior of  Y  and our assessment of its behavior. We pose a two-person zero-sum game with \phi as the payoff function so that b(\Lambda) is chosen by us to minimize \phi , whereas  f(\Lambda) is chosen by nature to maximize  \phi .

"The Relational Data File (RDF) of The Rand Corporation is among the most developed of question-answering systems. The ""information language"" of this system is an applied predicate calculus. The atomic units of information are binary relational sentences. The system has an inference-making capacity.As part of the actual construction and implementation of the RDF, a theory was developed by J. L. Kuhns to identify those formulas of the predicate calculus which represent the ""reasonable"" inquiries to put to this system. Accordingly, the classes of definite and proper formulus were defined, and their properties studied. The definite formulas share a semantic property Kuhns judged as necessarily possessed by a reasonable question to be processed by the RDF. The author has previously shown that the decision problem for the class of definite formulas is recursively unsolvable. The proper formulas are definite, and satisfy additional syntactic conditions intended to make them especially suitable for machine processing. The class of proper formulas depends on which logical primitives are employed. Different primitives give rise to different classes of formulas. A formula which can be effectively transformed into a proper equivalent is admissible. Kuhns conjectures that with respect to one particular class of proper formulas, all definite formulas are admissible. In the paper it is shown that the decision problem for several classes of proper formulas is solvable. The following results are established. Theorem 1: The class of proper formulas in prenex form on any complete set of connectives is recursive. Theorem 2: The class of proper formulas on ¬, ∨, ∃ is recursive. Theorem 3: The class of proper formulas on ¬, ⊃, ∃ is recursive. Theorem 4: The class of proper formulas on ¬, ⊃, ∨, ∃, is recursive. Thus, there is a mechanical decision procedure which determines whether an arbitrary formula is a member of the class. It follows that the analogues of Kuhns' conjecture for these classes are false.",['Robert A.

The problem studied is how to select a path through the network for each point-to-point demand for communications channels, so that the total network cost is minimized. The problem is to minimize total network cost, subject to multicommodity flow requirements and concave link cost functions. Finding an exact solution is difficult because of the concavity of the cost functions and the complexity (100 to 200 nodes and 200 to 300 links) of the network structure. A specialized technique is developed to provide locally optimal solutions to the problem, one of minimizing a concave function over a convex constraint set. When the link cost displays a fixed charge, a modification of the iterative algorithm provides acceptable a modification of the iterative algorithm provides acceptable solutions.

The axioms used concern the speed, packing density and noise threshold of the energy with which any computing device detects or alters the physical representation of information. The principal result is that TD(n) grows at least as n1/3. Composite systems consisting of spatially distributed identical components are examined in light of this bound.

It is shown that an equivalent normal primitive flow table of any reduced flow table has n binary partitions with substitutioh property such that their product is a 2 n block partition with substitution property, where n is the number of binary inputs. Such a property leads directly to a circuit which realizes the flow table and is a serial connection of two smaller subcircuits.

For the infinite-horizon, average-reward criterion, it shows that, among all stationary policies, the optimal strategies are control-limit rules of the form: join if and only if the queue size is not greater than some specific number. However, it finds that, in general, exercising self-optimization does not optimize public good.

"A lower bound to the rate-distortion function R(D) of finite-alphabet sources with memory is derived for the class of balanced distortion measures. For finite-state finite-alphabet Markov sources, sufficient conditions are given for the existence of a strictly positive average distortion D_c such that R(D) equals its lower bound for 0 \leqq D \leqq D_c . The bound is evaluated for the Hamming and Lee distortion measures and is identical to the corresponding bound for memoryless sources having the same entropy and alphabet.

"The services received by a process from a time-sharing operating system can be characterized by a resource count ∑  w   i   R   ij   where  R   ij   is the number of units of service received by process  j  from resource  i  and  w   i   is the cost per unit of the service.

A scheduling and swapping algorithm which keeps the resource count of each process above its policy function will provide the specified level of service.

Abstract   We describe a new problem solver called STRIPS that attempts to find a sequence of operators in a space of world models to transform a given initial world model in which a given goal formula can be proven to be true. STRIPS represents a world model as an arbitrary collection in first-order predicate calculus formulas and is designed to work with models consisting of large numbers of formula. It employs a resolution theorem prover to answer questions of particular models and uses means-ends analysis to guide it to the desired goal-satisfying model.,"['Richard Fikes', 'Nils J.

"Any switching function can always be realized by a single multithreshold threshold element possessing a suitable number of thresholds. However, the practical realization of such elements often presents serious difficulties; as such it becomes more convenient to realize the given function in the form of a network of multi-threshold threshold elements, each possessing fewer thresholds. In this paper, a thorough study of these networks with different modes of interconnection has been made. These discussions have been limited to constant weight (CW) networks only. Finally, a technique for obtaining the three-threshold network configuration for an arbitrary k-threshold function has also been suggested.

"Families of languages recognized by multi-head writing finite automata are considered. For n≥1, an n-head writing finite automaton (n-wfa) is a finite state device with n one-way read-write heads on a single input tape. Relationships between families of languages recognized by n-wfa (Wn) and other models (e.g. n-head nonwriting finite automata, linear-bounded automata, and real-time buffer automata) are established. A complexity measure is defined for computations by two-head writing finite automata. This measure is obtained from a sequence which encodes the motion of the two heads. A relationship between complexity classes for 2-wfa and one-tape off-line Turing machines is then derived. Using this relationship, a number of sets are shown to be unrecognizable by any 2-wfa.

"Universal base functions (UBF's) are defined which are generalizations of universal logic functions. An (n, m, r)-UBF can be implemented as a single module (UBM) with n+m inputs and 1 output. An arbitrary n-variable switching function fn (X) is then realized on the fixed UBM by realizing a suitable set of m r-variable functions with which to drive m inputs of the UBM, the remaining n inputs being driven by X. The fan-in of a UBM for r ≥ 2 is shown to be considerably less than that of a Universal Logic Module (a special case corresponding to r = 1). Specific UBF's are proposed for r = 2 in which m is on the order of 60% of the value obtained by using the UBF defined by the familiar Shannon decomposition formula. This is close to the theoretical lower bound on m. The use of UBM's provides a new way to realize an arbitrary function or set of functions, completely specified or otherwise, by assembling a small number of circuits selected from a small set of standard logic modules of limited fan-in. For the case r = 2, the number of 2-input devices required to drive the m inputs of the UBM is often considerably less than m. DON'T CARES can be used to advantage to reduce this number still further. Realizations based on a UBM (n=6, m=12, r=2) were computed for over 1000 randomly generated completely specified functions grouped, exclusively, into sets of 1,2,3 and 4 output functions. Most (86%) single output functions required no more than 8 2-input devices to drive the 12 control inputs of the UBM, while most (79%) simultaneous realizations of sets of 4 functions required an average of no more than 6 such devices per output function. More detailed results are provided. Array type realizations of UBM's are proposed such that each can itself be built from multiple copies of a rather limited number of submodule types, each with n+2 inputs.","['Mohamed Y. Osman', 'C.

"An algorithm is presented which enables certain matrix multiplications in a digital computer to be implemented with a considerable savings in storage and computational operations. For NxN matrix vector multiplication (that is a multiplication of a matrix by a vector) a maximum of N Σn-1 r=0 p r , storage words are necessary compared to normal full matrix storage requirements of N 2 locations. In addition only N Σn-1 r=0 P r , computer operations are necessary compared to N 2 operation in a general vector matrix multiplication. N is chosen to be a highly composite number, N= πn-1 r=0 p r , and the p r , are integers. The algorithm takes advantage of the redundancies in the definition of certain matrices and develops a matrix description based on the number of degrees of freedom necessary in defining an NxN matrix. The algorithm is optimal in the sense that it describes a vector matrix multiplication in exactly as many operations as available degrees of freedom N σn-1 r=0 P r (no greater number of degrees of freedom could be implemented in fewer operations). The matrix transformation formulation is based largely on noting the use of lexicographic positional digit notation in keeping track of the few parameters describing the final N by N matrix. The algorithm includes the generation of the fast Fourier transform, fast Hadamard transform, fast Walsh transform, fast Kronecker matrix transform, and an infinite class of transformations unnamed but potentially useful in generalized spectral analysis as well as coding, bandwidth reduction, and feature selection.","['Harry C.

"Several feedback coding schemes considered recently are repetitive signaling schemes. The sender retransmits the message, if necessary, on the basis of information received over the feedback channel. This paper considers a repetitive signaling scheme in which the user's estimate of the transmitted message is sent over the feedback channel to the sender with high energy if the user is uncertain of the estimate and with lower energy if otherwise. The sender retransmits the message with high energy if it decides the user's estimate is incorrect. This scheme is applied to a wide-band, additive-white-Gaussian-noise, average-power-constrained feedback communication system. Orthogonal signals are used for transmission over both forward and feedback channels. A lower bound is obtained for the probability of error when arbitrary decision rules are used. This lower bound is achieved asymptotically for long block duration by using decision rules implemented with correlation receivers. The resulting asymptotic error performance is superior to that of any feedback coding scheme previously considered for use in a wide-band additive-white-Gaussian-noise system for any values of the forward and feedback channel capacities.",['Stephen S.

"First it is shown how the Karhunen-Loeve approach to the detection of a deterministic signal can be given a coordinate-free and geometric interpretation in a particular Hilbert space of functions that is uniquely determined by the covariance function of the additive Gaussian noise. This Hilbert space, which is called a reproducing-kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), has many special properties that appear to make it a natural space of functions to associate with a second-order random process. A mapping between the RKHS and the linear Hilbert space of random variables generated by the random process is studied in some detail. This mapping enables one to give a geometric treatment of the detection problem. The relations to the usual integral-equation approach to this problem are also discussed. Some of the special properties of the RKHS are developed and then used to study the singularity and stability of the detection problem and also to suggest simple means of approximating the detectability of the signal. The RKHS for several multidimensional and multivariable processes is presented; by going to the RKHS of functionals rather than functions it is also shown how generalized random processes, including white noise and stationary processes whose spectra grow at infinity, are treated.",['Thomas Kailath'],162,"['13b34dd3-5ae9-4337-8a76-c34d808554c6', '1a2fd329-7d65-49ca-8231-e265285cc949', '7e80cdd5-05b6-4550-b0ec-b862e3c31b65', '96460baa-0437-4603-b40e-7dd59544bcd3', 'd1214d06-95c5-4ce5-a7da-72be8c48ab29']",RKHS approach to detection and estimation problems--I: Deterministic signals in Gaussian noise,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,1971,f893652f-46f9-47b9-b76a-9d6731cb206e

"A complex multidimensional decision hypersurface can be approximated by a set of polynomials in the input signals (properties) which contain information about the hypersurface of interest. The hypersurface is usually described by a number of experimental (vector) points and simple functions of their coordinates. The approach taken in this paper to approximating the decision hypersurface, and hence the input-output relationship of a complex system, is to fit a high-degree multinomial to the input properties using a multilayered perceptronlike network structure. Thresholds are employed at each layer in the network to identify those polynomials which best fit into the desired hypersurface. Only the best combinations of the input properties are allowed to pass to succeeding layers, where more complex combinations are formed. Each element in each layer in the network implements a nonlinear function of two inputs. The coefficients of each element are determined by a regression technique which enables each element to approximate the true outputs with minimum mean-square error. The experimental data base is divided into a training and testing set. The training set is used to obtain the element coefficients, and the testing set is used to determine the utility of a given element in the network and to control overfitting of the experimental data. This latter feature is termed ""decision regularization.",['Ivakhnenko Ag'],206,[],Polynomial Theory of Complex Systems,systems man and cybernetics,1971,b8a2354a-b78c-436d-9aa0-5270d88cf418

Especially, the algorithm requires at most n3 additions and comparisons when applied to an n-by-n assignment problem, as compared with the theoretical upper bound proportional to n4 for the number of such operations required by currently available methods.

The encoding of a source whose probability distribution varies arbitrarily from letter to letter is considered. The problem is formulated as a two-person statistical game. The exponential rate of growth with block length of the minimum number of codewords needed to achieve a specified fidelity with respect to a single-letter distortion measure is determined. The rate distortion function of a source whose statistics are entirely unknown is obtained as a special case. The dependence of the results on the rules under which the game is played also is studied.

This paper studies the effect of inaccuracies in the block probabilities and gives coding procedures that anticipate some of the worst errors. For an efficient code, the mean number d of digits per letter must be kept small. In some cases the expected value of d can be related to the size of the sample on which probability estimates are based.

"Computing the accuracy with which guns and similar weapon systems deliver ordnance is, in its most general context, a problem in the theory of discrete stochastic processes. Thus, the classic methods of computing hit probability by assuming the impact points to be isolated random variables are much too restrictive to be of general use. As a result, there exists in the literature a profusion of formulas, tables, and computational methods whose applications are limited to a variety of special cases. This in itself is no handicap as long as a unifying theory exists from which all these special cases follow. However, it is precisely the lack of such a theory that has made the available results ambiguous, confusing, and generally unsatisfying. The aim of this paper is to remedy this situation by providing a theoretical framework for the concise definition of hit distribution and its computation. The subjects treated are the various types of errors inherent in gun systems, and a general discussion of hit distribution and its computation, as well as a detailed analysis of independent and Markov-dependent rounds and the diffuse-target approximation.",['Hermann J.

"The stationary distribution of the number of jobs being served by a processor-sharing central server is independent of both the distribution of service times and the distribution of interarrival times when those distributions have rational Laplace-Stieltjes transforms. This result holds for both finite source and infinite source models. The steady state is identical to the steady state when all distributions are exponential. The expected response time, queue size, and central processor idle time of the finite source model under processor-sharing and FCFS scheduling are compared.

"A multidisciplinary team is currently studying the applicability of computer simulation to problems of agricultural sector development in Nigeria. The program has as one of its major objectives the exploration of simulation as a tool for aiding policy makers of that country concerned with meeting the nutritional needs of the population, generation of foreign exchange earnings and raw material inputs for industrialization, and other important questions relating to long-run development of the agricultural sector and its interaction with nonagricultural development. While the project is localized in a particular country, models are being developed with adaptability to other developing areas of the world as a major objective. To date, a model of the northern region of the country has been developed which will be linked to a southern model currently under construction. The structure of the northern model is described in some detail as an example of the application of simulation to a macroeconomic system. Preliminary tests of this model are discussed and an assessment of the capabilities and limitations of this approach to planning development in emerging countries is given.","['Thomas J.

A process of evolutionary growth through accretion of new components has taken place in contrast to the revolution in the programming and systems areas.

"A situation of great practical importance in pattern recognition is the case where the designer has only a finite number of sample patterns from each class and the class-conditional density functions are not completely known. Recent results indicate that in this case the dimensionality of the pattern vector, i.e., the number of measurements, should not be arbitrarily increased, since above a certain value (corresponding to the optimal measurement complexity), the performance starts to deteriorate instead of improving steadily. However, whether this phenomenon occurs in the case of independent measurements has been an open question until now. In this paper the following result of practical importance is derived. When the measurements are independent, and a Bayesian approach is taken, one can add extra measurements without fear of this peaking of performance; i.e., the optimal measurement complexity is infinite. In fact, under certain conditions, having just one sample from class 1, and none at all from class 2, can result in a recognition accuracy arbitrarily close to unity for a large enough number of measurements. The implication of these results to practice is discussed, along with the general question of dimensionality and sample size.",['Balakrishnan Chandrasekaran'],61,['278efe1a-689a-4b53-b92c-93c8129bcb1b'],Independence of measurements and the mean recognition accuracy,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,1971,c0b9b5e1-b11c-4a8c-b643-91c76a04dd2c

"A method, called conditional interpretation, is proposed which will allow small computers to have as large a set of instructions as may be desired without using a large number of bits to hold the operation code. The method is based on the redundancy of machine language instruction sequences. Most machine language instructions have a limited number of ""reasonable"" successors. For example ""load accumulator"" hardly ever follows ""enter accumulator."" It turns out that if each instruction is allowed seven successors plus an ""escape instruction,"" only about one out of every five instructions needs to be an ""escape"" to get to one of the less usual successors. Seventy-five percent of the time the desired ""next instruction"" is among the seven permitted successors. Since each instruction has its own, possibly unique, set of successors, the interpretation of the stored op-code is conditional upon the state of the machine.","['Caxton C. Foster', 'Robert H.

"The generalized Shannon lower bound to the rate-distortion function R(D) for stationary sources with memory is extended to a wide class of distortion measures involving no symmetry conditions. The lower bound R_{L} (D) is a reasonably simple function of the entropy and marginal probabilities of the source and the per-letter distortion measure. Sufficient conditions only slightly less general than necessary conditions are given for the existence of a strictly positive cutoff distortion D_c such that R(D) = R_{L} (D) for D \leq D_c . The sufficient conditions are the most general to date and include all previously known examples. This provides a nearly complete resolution of the question of when the Shannon-type lower bound to the rate-distortion function of a source with memory is tight. The results are applied to generalize earlier results for balanced distortion measures and Markov sources to nonbalanced distortion measures and wide-sense Markov sources. As a special case, it is shown that D_c > 0 for all finite-alphabet autoregressive sources. As an example, R_{L} (D) is evaluated for the first-order ternary autoregressive source for a balanced (Hamming) and a nonbalanced (modular distance) distortion measure. A simple lower bound to D_c is derived for this example.",['Robert M.

"Ambiguity is a pervasive and important aspect of natural language. Ambiguities, which are disambiguated by context, contribute powerfully to the expressiveness of natural language as compared to formal languages. In computational systems using natural language, problems of properly controlling ambiguity are particularly large, partially because of the necessity to circumvent parsings due to multiple orderings in the application of rules.Features, that is, subcategorizations of parts-of-speech, constitute an effective means for controlling syntactic ambiguity through ordering the hierarchical organization of syntactic constituents. This is the solution adopted for controlling ambiguity in REL English, which is part of the REL (Rapidly Extensible Language) System. REL is a total software system for facilitating man/machine communications. The efficiency of processing natural language in REL English is achieved both by the detailed syntactic aspects which are incorporated into the REL English grammar, and by means of the particular implementation for processing features in the parsing algorithm.","['Bozena Henisz Dostert', 'Frederick B.

"The following model for the white Gaussian channel with or without feedback is considered: \begin{equation} Y(t) = \int_o ^{t} \phi (s, Y_o ^{s} ,m) ds + W(t) \end{equation} where m denotes the message, Y(t) denotes the channel output at time t , Y_o ^ {t} denotes the sample path Y(\theta), 0 \leq \theta \leq t.

"This paper appears in the March, 1972, issue of the Communications of the ACM. Its abstract is reproduced below.   An operating system which is organized as a small supervisor and a set of independent processes are described. The supervisor handles I/O with external devices - the file and directory system - schedules active processes and manages memory, handles errors, and provides a small set of primitive functions which it will execute for a process. A process is able to specify a request for a complicated action on the part of the supervisor (usually a wait on the occurrence of a compound event in the system) by combining these primitives into a “supervisory computer program.” The part of the supervisor which executes these programs may be viewed as a software implemented “supervisory computer.” The paper develops these concepts in detail, outlines the remainder of the supervisor, and discusses some of the advantages of this approach.",['R.

"Modelling of computer programs by directed graphs, where the vertices represent the computational tasks and the arcs show the flow of control, has been used for optimization purposes, parallel processing evaluation, and segmentation. All these studies are mainly based on the fact that a high proportion of the execution time of a program is spent in loops. Although the cyclic structure of programs can be theoretically complex, it has been observed that the nestedness is seldom very deep. Thus if one wants to optimize programs written in a high-level language, the detection of cycles by the compiler and its use in an optimization phase may yield a definite improvement in execution time without having to pay too heavily for excess compiling time. In this paper we show how a compiler could make use of an efficient cycle detection algorithm to model the embeddedness of cycles by an acyclic directed graph. The latter can then be used for packing purposes in case of a paging or ""cache"" memory system as well as for predicting the expected number of executions of a given statement for optimization purposes.","['Jean-Loup Baer', 'Robert A.

"This paper reports upon a project intended to hypothesize and implement with data methods for linking input-output structures and environmental emissions in order to provide suitable means for modeling and analyzing the emissions process. The first step in the effort was to devise a materials balance accounting structure in order to provide a coherent and complete format for emissions. This accounting structure was incorporated in a set of worksheets and instructions and distributed among relevant government agencies. The data collected from this effort, with substantial internally developed data, have been used to create a simple two-stage model of the emissions process. It is recommended that this approach be enhanced through more detailed study of treatment processes in terms of materials flows and economic costs. Integration of superior treatment process data into the existing structure would permit a much more flexible, detailed, and accurate model for projection and policy analysis purposes.","['John H.

For each of two classes the eigenfunctions of the autocorrelation function are found, and a proper subset of each one is chosen.

"The concept of a white Gaussian noise (WGN) innovations process has been used in a number of detection and estimation problems. However, there is fundamentally no special reason why WGN should be preferred over any other process, say, for example, an nth-order stationary autoregressive process. In this paper, we show that by working with the proper metric, any Gaussian process can be used as the innovations process. The proper metric is that of the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This is not unexpected, but what is unexpected is that in this metric some basic concepts, like that of a causal operator and the distinction between a causal and a Volterra operator, have to be carefully reexamined and defined more precisely and more generally. It is shown that if the problem of deciding between two Gaussian processes is nonsingular, then there exists a causal (properly defined) and causally invertible transformation between them. Thus either process can be regarded as a generalized innovations process. As an application, it is shown that the likelihood ratio (LR) for two arbitrary Gaussian processes can, when it exists, be written in the same form as the LR for a known signal in colored Gaussian noise. This generalizes a similar result obtained earlier for white noise. The methods of Gohberg and Krein, as specialized to reproducing kernel spaces, are heavily used.","['Thomas Kailath', 'Donald L.

"The development of PRADIS was started in early 1968 as a vehicle to implement and evaluate new schemes of man-machine-interaction, data base organization, and hidden-line detection which were being developed in our laboratory. With time it evolved into a rather elaborate programming system for generation, construction, manipulation, and perspective display of arbitrary three-dimensional objects. All relevant object types such as polyhedrons or groups of polyhedrons with convex or concave structure, objects that are described by analytical expression, as well as the most general case of objects that are bounded by arbitrarily curved surfaces can be handled. Different modes of defining and inputting objects and different-hidden-line suppression algorithms have been individually developed and implemented for these various types. Man-machine-communication has been facilitated by defining a simple command language for the user. The execution of any command can be initiated by pointing to the respective instruction in a command menu. Additionally, a keyboard (or the console typewriter) can be used for specification of parameters or the description of objects by analytical equations. Subroutines for scaling, translation, and rotation are part of the system as well as program modules which enable the user to construct three-dimensional objects by drawing two-dimensional views of them.","['José L.

Abstract#R##N##R##N#In a recent article (1) Gerard Salton considered the question of how certain retrieval parameters can be estimated for large collections from their values in small collections. The purpose of this communication is to suggest that in the situation where documents are retrieved independently the desired parameters may be estimated more accurately by sampling and averaging techniques over homogeneous subparts of the data base. It is also suggested that certain changes in the nomenclature of the parameters would help to avoid ambiguities in their interpretation.,['Richard S.

"This paper is concerned with the differences between deterministic and randomized finite-memory decision rules. It is shown that for any hypothesis-testing problem there exists a b  such that, for any B , the optimal deterministic rule with B + b bits in memory has a lower error probability than the optimal randomized rule with B bits in memory. Suboptimal deterministic rules with this property are demonstrated. These deterministic rules lose at most b bits. Thus for large memories the fraction of memory, measured in bits, lost by deterministic rules is negligible.",['Martin E.

"A new model for associative memory, based on a correlation matrix, is suggested. In this model information is accumulated on memory elements as products of component data. Denoting a key vector by q (p) , and the data associated with it by another vector x (p) , the pairs (q (p) , x (p) ) are memorized in the form of a matrix {see the Equation in PDF File} where c is a constant. A randomly selected subset of the elements of M xq  can also be used for memorizing. The recalling of a particular datum x (r)  is made by a transformation x (r) =M xq q (r) . This model is failure tolerant and facilitates associative search of information; these are properties that are usually assigned to holographic memories. Two classes of memories are discussed: a complete correlation matrix memory (CCMM), and randomly organized incomplete correlation matrix memories (ICMM). The data recalled from the latter are stochastic variables but the fidelity of recall is shown to have a deterministic limit if the number of memory elements grows without limits. A special case of correlation matrix memories is the auto-associative memory in which any part of the memorized information can be used as a key. The memories are selective with respect to accumulated data. The ICMM exhibits adaptive improvement under certain circumstances. It is also suggested that correlation matrix memories could be applied for the classification of data.",['Teuvo Kohonen'],1032,[],Correlation Matrix Memories,IEEE Transactions on Computers,1972,7038f53e-235c-46e2-823d-bf44abb724e8

"Many applications of Walsh functions employ Walsh series expansions. To obtain the advantage of data compression many of the Walsh coefficients must be negligible. It is thus desirable to have a scheme by which their magnitudes can be estimated with little computation. We found that the Walsh transform Fi of a function that can be differentiated by an arbitrary number of times is expressible as a weighted average of one of its derivatives. The mean and maximum of the weighting function is readily expressed in terms of i, from which we derived two upper bounds on Fi depending only on i and the maximum or mean magnitude of the derivative. As the bounds decrease rapidly with increasing degree and rank, Walsh transforms with high degree and rank are negligible. We also proved that discrete Walsh transforms calculated using sampled values obey the same bounds. While bounds can also be found for transforms of functions that can be differentiated by only a finite number of times, they tend to be larger and less dependent on rank. As most autocorrelation functions have singularities in second derivative, bounds on Walsh power spectra depend only on degree. Computed examples show that the behavior of Walsh spectra closely follow that of their upper bounds.",['C. K.

"A hardwired device that produces a voltage with arbitrary amplitude distribution was constructed using a ""conditional bit"" algorithm to sample from an arbitrary voltage amplitude distribution. The sampling algorithm and hardware processor are independent of the distribution sampled. Only a small read-only memory ROM needs to be changed to alter the distribution sampled. It is possible to compute the accuracy of the sampled random variables from knowledge of the read-only memory contents. The sampling accuracy of the device may be arbitrarily increased by varying any of several design parameters. Our particular pseudonoise generator produced 200 000 random seven-bit variables/s.

"Since covariance matrices of weakly stationary random processes are Toeplitz, much of the theory involving asymptotic results for such processes is simply the theory of the asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz forms. The fundamental theorem of this type is the Szego theorem on the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of Toeplitz matrices. This theorem is often quoted but relatively little understood in the engineering literature. In this tutorial paper we prove the Szegio theorem for the special case of finite-order Toeplitz matrices. In this setting the mathematical sophistication of the classical proofs is not required and the proof is both simple and intuitive--yet it contains the important concepts involved in the most general case.",['Robert M.

"In my opinion, Dijkstra's ""Humble Programmer"" ought to be required reading for everyone who claims that programming is his or her profession. To me, it ranks as one of the great classics in the field, providing an educational experience for the junior programmer, and truly delightful reading for the veteran. It serves as a wonderful reminder of the good old days of the computer field, and offers an excellent summary of the philosophies and guiding principles by which we try to do our jobs. The concepts expressed are eloquent and profound, sometimes controversial, and generally thought-provoking.#R##N##R##N#I worry that some of the most eloquent remarks cannot be appreciated by today's programmers: For example, Dijkstra says, "" . . . when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild problem, and now that we have gigantic computers, programming has become an equally gigantic problem."" Most of us who began our careers on 1K or 4K machines will smile in appreciation, but will the remarks mean anything to the programmer of the 1980s who will begin his or her career on a 16-megabyte computer? When Dijkstra states, "" . . . one of the most important aspects of any computing tool is its influence on the thinking habits of those who try to use it,"" I wonder whether today's hobbyist programmer, with his buildit- at-home computer and subset of BASIC, has any idea of what Dijkstra is talking about.#R##N##R##N#There are the controversial comments, too: For instance, Dijkstra refers to FORTRAN as an infantile disorder, and PL/I as a fatal disease. Curiously enough, even though he praises such obscure languages as LISP, he does not seem to acknowledge the existence of the two languages that account for probably 75 percent of all the computer programs written today: COBOL and RPG.#R##N##R##N#It is in this paper as well that Dijkstra suggests that the primary resistance to the so-called structured revolution will come from educational institutions, and from the political backlash of an EDP organization that would prefer to maintain the status quo. I personally agree with this, having experienced such resistance first-hand in my own work as a consultant and educator. You may or may not agree, but you certainly will find Dijkstra's comments worth reading.",['Edsger W.

In this paper, we present three new methods of performing square rooting rapidly which utilize multiplication and no division.

The most typical and efficient one of the already-known algorithms which utilizes multiplication, here called the N algorithm, is introduced for the purpose of comparison with the new algorithms.

"The earlier theory (Parts I and II) is extended to include the determination of various important statistics of the reverberation process under the broadened conditions of and using the results for the scattered and reflected fields developed in Part III. The new conditions involve nonzero velocity gradients, absorbing media, and multiple reflections, as well as the usual Doppler, general signals and apertures, and mono- and bistatic operation. Of principal interest are the mean return (specular reflection), the mean intensity, and the covariance of these generally nonstationary processes, following reception by the receiving aperture. These we determine under the basic Poisson assumptions of primarily independent single scattering, as before. Also of major importance are the auto- and cointensity spectra associated with the various second-order statistics. General relations for these and higher order moments are indicated. The quasi-stationary cases of ""short"" narrow-band signals occur in many practical operational situations and are treated here in detail, under a variety of general and special conditions, appropriate to both oceanographic and general communication applications (e.g., detection and classification). The development of our quasi-phenomenological model (Parts I-IV) concludes with a critique of the role of the Poisson assumption of independent scatterers in both volume and surface scatter and a short account of possible and needed extensions of the present ""macroscopic"" theory to one that is fully physical at the ""microscopic"" level as well.",['David Middleton'],6,"['acc6290a-bce8-44a6-98be-6b2c18a50265', 'b32d4fef-675d-4bb2-83d2-0d09fbdc1744']",A statistical theory of reverberation and similar first-order scattered fields--IV: Statistical models,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,1972,67c3bd4d-656e-482d-9224-e1cf227af10e
"In this paper we consider the problem of estimation and detection of Weak optical signals formulated as a problem in point process theory. Indeed at very low light intensity the only information available from an intensity detector is the random distribution of time instants \{t_i \} at which photons of the field are absorbed and photoelectrons emitted. There is also a noise due to thermoelectrons or to a background optical field. Starting from the statistical properties of the point process \{t_i\} , we formulate for various kinds of optical fields the problem of estimation of the light intensity of a modulated beam. We show that in some cases the number of photoelectrons is a sufficient statistic. In general, theoretical results are complex and we formulate the problem in the case of linear estimation, which is solved by means of the resolvent of an integral equation using the covariance function of the field. Some detection problems are also considered.","['Odile M. Macchi', 'B.

A method is presented that detects behavioral transients in waveforms. A structure is defined that accepts waveforms as inputs and generates a sequence of symbols representing the sequence of transients present in the waveform. This structure is developed by generalizing an unsupervised learning algorithm to the time-varying case. The algorithm accepts a sequence of unlabeled waveforms to find cluster centers associated with the transients. Clustering is assumed to be with respect to an arbitrary distance measure. This measure is assumed to satisfy differentiability and regularity requirements. The algorithm is shown to converge based on assumptions concerning a unique optimum. This is done by the application of a stochastic-approximation theorem to a gradient-following technique. The resulting algorithm is applied to a problem in speech processing. The structure resulting from the learning algorithm is compared to the standard linguistic phonetic structure.,"['William J. Steingrandt', 'Stephen S.

A method is given for determining when a machine can be implemented with either trigger or set?reset flip-flop memory elements where the feedback in the machine is given by a Boolean function f. Several results are presented that compare the feedback when a machine is implemented with different memory elements. It is shown that if a sequential machine can be implemented with unit delay memory elements with feedback function f, then it can be realized with set-reset flip-flop with the same feedback function f. For completely specified machines, it is shown that if a machine implemented with trigger flip-flop has no feedback, then the some machine implemented with unit delays will have feedback. Conversely, if an implementation with unit delays has no feedback, then an implementation with trigger flip-flops will have feedback.","['Charles A. Harlow', 'Clarence L.

An upper bound on the rate-distortion function for discrete ergodic sources with memory is developed by partitioning the source sample space into a finite number of disjoint subsets and bounding the rates for each subset. The bound depends only on the mean vectors and covariance matrices for the subsets and is easy to compute. It is tighter than the Gaussian bound for sources that exhibit clustering of either the values or covariances of successive source outputs. The bound is evaluated for a certain class of pictorial data using both one-dimensional and two-dimensional blocks of picture elements. Two-dimensional blocks yield a tighter bound than one-dimensional blocks; both result in a significantly tighter bound than the Gaussian bound.,"['Manfred Tasto', 'P. A.

"Recent years have seen continuing and increasingly-intensive attempts to extend the art of simulation to areas which heretofore were considered too complex and too difficult to lend themselves to conventional modelling and simulation techniques. These include such environment-oriented fields as air-pollution, water conservation, thermal pollution, etc., as well as systems belonging to the biological, the medical, the economic, and sociological areas. For example, in 1970 the Office of Water Resources Research catalogued over 600 on-going research projects concerned with the modelling of water resource systems. The extension of simulation techniques developed in application areas such as control system design, electro-mechanical systems, etc., to these new areas has often been disappointing, if not completely unsuccessful. This is due to the difficulty in constructing a sufficiently-valid mathematical model---a model which can be used for prediction with a reasonable amount of confidence. It is well-known, of course, that even under the best conditions, inverse problems such as system identification problems, do not have unique solutions. That is, inevitably an infinite number of possible models will satisfy a specified set of excitation/response relationships. Where the identification process is further handicapped by uncertainties as to system structure and inadequate experimental data, the pertinent question is often not: ""How good is the model?"" but rather: ""Is there any point to modelling at all?""",['Walter J.

Turing machines and recursive functions were the first approaches, but these models, which provide much interesting mathematics, do not look at the problem from a practical standpoint. In ""real"" computing, no one uses Turing machines to evaluate polynomials or to multiply matrices, and little of practical significance is obtained from that approach.

"By defining mutual information as a maximum over an appropriate space, channel capacities can be defined as double maxima and rate-distortion functions as double minima. This approach yields valuable new insights regarding the computation of channel capacities and rate-distortion functions. In particular, it suggests a simple algorithm for computing channel capacity that consists of a mapping from the set of channel input probability vectors into itself such that the sequence of probability vectors generated by successive applications of the mapping converges to the vector that achieves the capacity of the given channel. Analogous algorithms then are provided for computing rate-distortion functions and constrained channel capacities. The algorithms apply both to discrete and to continuous alphabet channels or sources. In addition, a formalization of the theory of channel capacity in the presence of constraints is included. Among the examples is the calculation of close upper and lower bounds to the rate-distortion function of a binary symmetric Markov source.",['Richard E.

In an optimum pattern-recognition system the error rate is determined by the reject function. This correspondence describes how this property may be exploited to provide quantitative tests of model validity using unclassified test samples. These tests are basically goodness-of-fit tests for a function of the observations. One of these tests is shown to provide an improved estimate of error in Monte Carlo studies of complex systems. Results are given for normal distributions when parameters are estimated. In this case error estimates obtained from the empirical reject rate underestimate the actual error and performance depends on the ratio of design samples to dimension.,"['Keinosuke Fukunaga', 'David L.

"A nonparametric sequential pattern classifier called a linear sequential classifier (LSC) is presented. The pattern components are measured sequentially and the decisions either to measure the next component or to stop and classify the pattern are made using linear functions derived from sample patterns based on the least mean-square error criterion. The required linear functions are computed using an adaption of Greville's recursive algorithm for computing the generalized inverse of a matrix. A recursive algorithm for computing the least mean-square error is given and is used to determine the order in which the pattern components are measured. Under the assumption of two equiprobable classes that are normally distributed with equal covariance matrices, it is shown that the LSC is equivalent to Wald's sequential probability ratio test.

We also develop algorithms for these and related problems for trees, where the patterns are subtrees. Certain special cases of these algorithms are also discussed.

"Amplitude quantization and permutation encoding are two of the many approaches to efficient digitization of analog data. It is shown in this paper that these seemingly different approaches actually are equivalent in the sense that their optimum rate versus distortion performances are identical. Although this equivalence becomes exact only when the quantizer output is perfectly entropy coded and the permutation code block length is infinite, it nonetheless has practical consequences both for quantization and for permutation encoding. In particular, this equivalence permits us to deduce that permutation codes provide a readily implementable block-coding alternative to buffer-instrumented variable-length codes. Moreover, the abundance of methods in the literature for optimizing quantizers with respect to various criteria can be translated directly into algorithms for generating source permutation codes that are optimum for the same purposes. The optimum performance attainable with quantizers (hence, permutation codes) of a fixed entropy rate is explored too. The investigation reveals that quantizers with uniformly spaced thresholds are quasi-optimum with considerable generality, and are truly optimum in the mean-squared sense for data having either an exponential or a Laplacian distribution. An attempt is made to provide some analytical insight into why simple uniform quantization is so good so generally.",['Toby Berger'],53,"['60211cff-1586-42dd-9669-ea8cbdd457b2', '78cf1ac1-3390-476b-b10d-13c1bc3adffc']",Optimum quantizers and permutation codes,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,1972,caa2aa28-3647-4e1d-b7da-31c4f457d05a

It is well known that it is often possible to obtain considerable data compression by encoding messages in long blocks. Usually the coding scheme for a specific source depends parametrically on the statistics of the source. Universal codes which are independent of the source statistics are introduced. These codes are shown to be asymptotically optimal in the sense that the probability of encoding error can be made vanishingly small for output rates no larger than those of optimal codes that do in fact depend on the statistics of the source. A particular universal coding scheme is introduced for which the encoding complexity increases no faster than the second power of the block length n and for which the encoding error vanishes exponentially with n . The discussion is limited to discrete-time finite-alphabet sources.,['Jacob Ziv'],50,"['d4e173db-1b98-4daa-ab45-5ae064f7e9c9', 'd72672ca-6ff3-4be7-a2da-817d81c1f477']",Coding of sources with unknown statistics--I: Probability of encoding error,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,1972,9919f52a-81b9-4a91-b16c-deb58aab4f26

"Equations are derived that describe the time evolution of the posterior statistics of a general Markov process that modulates the intensity function of an observed inhomogeneous Poisson counting process. The basic equation is a stochastic differential equation for the conditional characteristic function of the Markov process. A separation theorem is established for the detection of a Poisson process having a stochastic intensity function. Specifically, it is shown that the causal minimum-mean-square-error estimate of the stochastic intensity is incorporated in the optimum Reiffen-Sherman detector in the same way as if it were known. Specialized results are obtained when a set of random variables modulate the intensity. These include equations for maximum a posteriori probability estimates of the variables and some accuracy equations based on the Cramer-Rao inequality.

"Many cases arise in practice where a versatile hardwired pseudorandom number or pseudonoise generator would be extremely useful. General-purpose pseudonoise devices are not available today. We present a new sampling method, conditional bit sampling, which is suited for hardwired sampling devices because of its generality, simplicity, and accuracy. Random variables sampled from an arbitrary distribution are generated bit by bit from high- to low-order bits with the conditional bit algorithm. The result of a comparison of a uniform number to a conditional probability determines whether a bit in the sampled random number is set to one. The conditional probabilities are easily calculated for any probability distribution and must be arranged in special order. Simple Fortran programs make all necessary computations. Agreement between actual and theoretical performance of the conditional bit algorithm was excellent when sampling accuracy was evaluated for several examples of continuous and discrete densities. Sampling from empirically known, perhaps erratic-shaped, densities presents no problems. Only a small memory containing the conditional probabilities needs to be changed to alter the sampled distribution. The conditional bit algorithmic process always remains the same.","['Sobolewski J', 'William H.

"There have been very few systematic studies of the effect on system performance of strategies for scheduling jobs for execution in a multi-programming system. Most of this work has been concerned with empirical efforts to obtain job mixes which effectively utilize the central processor. These efforts are frequently carried out in commercial or production oriented installations where the job load consists of a relatively few jobs whose internal characteristics can be well determined. This approach is not feasible in an environment where internal job characteristics are not known before run time, or where internal job characteristics may vary rapidly. Such circumstances are often the case in an industrial or research laboratory or in a university computer center. This study uses as its measures for determining job scheduling strategies such quantities as are frequently known or can be accurately estimated such as amount of core memory required, processor service time required, etc. The specific job scheduling strategies used include first-come-first-serve (FCFS), shortest processor service time first (STF), smallest cost (cost = core size X processor service time) first (SCF), and smallest memory requirement first (SMF). We evaluated both preemptive resume and non-preemptive job scheduling. It is typical of virtually all of the previous work that the emphasis has been on improving CPU utilization. There may often be other goals which are more useful measures of performance such as throughput (job completion rate per unit time), the expected wait time before completion of a given class of job, the utilization of I/O resources, etc. We collected several measures of system performance including all of those listed previously to assess the effects of job scheduling. There has been very little previous study of the interaction between job scheduling and CPU scheduling. We systematically vary CPU scheduling algorithms in conjunction with alteration of job scheduling strategies. Those job scheduling strategies which give high throughput are characteristically observed to be more sensitive to CPU scheduling methods than those which yield relatively low throughput. We do not, however, attempt to correlate job scheduling methods with internal job characteristics such as CPU burst time, etc. We did, however, consider the effect of skewed CPU burst time distribution on performance under different pairs of strategies.","['James C.

"This paper derives the important measures of supply performance for an inventory model in which the replenishment policy is to reorder a unit whenever demand occurs. The performance measures considered are: the expected number of back-orders; the expected resupply and stockout times; and the probability distribution for resupply times. All demands, described by an arbitrary distribution, are captured, but need not necessarily be satisfied immediately. The delivery times are assumed constant. Also considered is the problem of trade-offs between spares and the delivery time to achieve a given level of supply performance at least cost.",['Rose Mm'],4,['7354a4e2-96ec-4e18-9796-25da7e676dd8'],"The (S-1, S) Inventory Model with Arbitrary Back- Ordered Demand and Constant Delivery Times",Operations Research,1972,7742e4b0-a519-4ae1-aa6c-f6f23fa209ef

The problem of developing an appropriate data base for syntax-directed pattern analysis and recognition is considered. A new data base is introduced by generalizing the notion of concatenation in representing patterns with a relationship matrix. The characteristics of relationship matrix are demonstrated in teh context of formal language theory. It is shown that this data base will allow us to remove many of the present restrictions placed on the types of patterns that can be handled by syntax-directed systems. Problems in pattern analysis (description and generation) as well as in pattern recognition are discussed and examples are given to illustrate the potential application of this data base in both of these areas.,"['Y.

"A higher level language derives its great power from the fact that it tends to impose structure on the problem solving behavior of the user. Besides providing a library of useful subroutines with a uniform calling sequence, the author of a higher level language imposes his theory of problem solving on the user. By choosing what primitive data structures, control structures, and operators he presents, he makes the implementation of some algorithms more difficult than others, thus discouraging some techniques and encouraging others. So, to be good, a higher level language must not only simplify the job of programming, by providing features which package programming structures commonly found in the domain for which the language was designed, it must also do its best to discourage the use of structures which lead to bad algorithms.","['Gerald Jay Sussman', 'Drew V.

"A computer center typically faces questions of how to deal with a growing load in the face of tight financial constraints and with the need for lead time for planning ways to meet the demand. The needs may be met by altering the equipment configuration, changing priority algorithms and other features of the operating system, controlling the time scheduling of various classes of job load, or perhaps shifting load from one machine to another if the center is large enough to have such a capability. It is often difficult to gather enough data and insight to show the direction these changes should go and to support the decision to do so. One useful set of tools is provided by simulation backed up by measurements required for validation. However, it is all too common to find that fear of interruptions of the computing center's service to user, combined with an overworked systems programming staff, prevents insertion of the desired measurement probes into the operating system. Then one is restricted to measures that can be derived from the normal accounting log, or ""Dayfile"", and to software probes that can be injected in the guise of user's programs. In spite of these limitations, useful results can be obtained, and this paper describes validation of a simulation model of a multiprogramming system, the Control Data 6400, making use of these restricted measurements.","['Jerre D.

"Two sequential permutation networks which generate all nǃ permutations without duplication are presented. Each permutation can be derived from its predecessor autonomously in one clock step. Based on the principle of recursive execution of a product of transpositions, the first network is constructed in multiple cascades of ½(n ² -n) switching elements each of which permutes its input pair to its output pair according to its internal state, and is controlled sequentially by the same principle. Next, the network whose structure and control sequence are complementary to those of the first is presented. The first is named a cyclic permutation network and is an explicit representation of a mapping function The second is named a lexicographic permutation network and is an explicit representation of a factorial counting function where ah is a h-nary factorial digit 0 ≤ ah ≤ (n-1). The characteristics of the networks are investigated by establishing a one-to-one correspondence among nI integers, n! permutations, and n! states of the networks.

"An intelligent robot that recognizes and assembles three-dimensional objects by means of vidicon cameras, an articulated mechanical hand, and a digital computer is described. Its problem-solving functions include three essential parts: the recognition of macro-instructions from a human master, the recognition of the objects to be handled, and the decision making for executing the necessary tasks. The instruction is in the form of a three-view plan of a simple polyhedral assemblage whose overall spatial configuration is recognized together with its component parts. In this process the set of planes of the assemblage is disassembled into open shells; these are then reconstructed into closed shells to find the parts by solving a linear equation where the shell vectors are taken into consideration. In the object recognition, all the geometric features of polygonal prisms in the field of vision are extracted to find the specific parts required for the assembly. Further computation is made to search for the assembly procedure and is based on the restraint vectors of each object and consequent disassembly free. Finally, the mechanical hand starts the autonomous manipulation of the parts so as to accomplish the assigned assembly.","['Masakazu Ejiri', 'Takeshi Uno', 'Haruo Yoda', 'Tatsuo Goto', 'Kiyoo Takeyasu']",16,"['8e0c5da1-f20b-4eaf-88f7-8bf4b37dea43', 'a58ea21e-273c-4267-aa83-77c151de153b']",A Prototype Intelligent Robot that Assembles Objects from Plan Drawings,IEEE Transactions on Computers,1972,d8b33166-63a0-4251-bd22-eb229963ce4c
"Network computers are becoming a reality in the seventies. While systems such as the ARPA Network, Carnegie Mellon's PLN, the Collins C-System, CDC's Cybernet, and GE's Time Share Net are coming to fruition, even more grandiose systems are being discussed. These networks all offer the designer the potential of combining the advantages of resource sharing, data base sharing, and message switching with those of design automation. In this paper we present a brief description of a network computer currently under development and then propose an interactive design automation system for this geographically distributed network.   The control mechanism for our design automation system is provided by an operating system, resident in each computer, whose primary function is to segment, disseminate, and regulate the jobs generated by the design automation system. When a job enters the system it may be assigned to anyone of the computers in a center. The job then runs to completion under control of that computer, but the segments that make up the job may be executed in any available computer. Additionally, we may transmit jobs between centers to improve the network response time. Thus we see that by detecting when segments are ready to be executed and by queueing this available work uniformly among all computers in the network, our design automation system will give each designer access to the full parallel processing power of the network.",['Edward K.

"A new representation for faults in combinational digital circuits is presented. Faults that are inherently indistinguishable are identified and combined into classes that form a geometric structure that effectively subdivides the original circuit into fan-out-free segments. This fan-out-free characteristic allows a simplified analysis of multiple fault conditions. For certain circuits, including all two-level single-output circuits, it is shown that the detection of all single faults implies the detection of all multiple faults. The behavior of any circuit under fault conditions is represented in terms of the classes of indistinguishable faults. This results in a description of the faulty circuit by means of Boolean equations that are readily manipulated for the purpose of fault simulation or test generation. A connection graph interpretation of this fault representation is discussed. Heuristic methods for the selection of efficient tests without extensive computation are derived from these connection graphs.","['Donald R.

A simulation model is presented which investigates the requirements of patient care in planning new hospitals on the basis of statistical data of health care needs in a community and different administrative policies for providing services. The minimum requirements for future service demands for planning patient care in a hospital on the basis of health statistics in a community are generated by synthetic random observations according to certain probability distributions. The model permits the investigation of the influence of admission control on the manifest service demands as well as the effects of the latter on the utilization of patient care facilities over a period of time. The consequences of possible alternatives for meeting the demands may be determined through experimentation with various time-dependent demand patterns and various policy decisions in planning and management.,"['Andrew K.

"The design of optimal logic networks is formulated as integer programming (IP) problems. This formulation has the following advantages over other methods of logic design. 1) General feed-forward networks can be dealt with rather than two-level or three-level networks usually treated in conventional switching theory. 2) Network restrictions such as fan-in and fan-out restrictions are easily incorporated. 3) Various gate types such as NOR, NAND, AND-OR combination, NOR-AND combination, and those gates with NOR-OR dual outputs can be treated. 4) Various objectives such as the number of gates and the number of connections are minimized. 5) Incompletely specified functions can be handled without additional difficulty. 6) The formulation can be extended to multiple-output networks. To solve the resulting IP problems, the implicit enumeration method of integer programming is found to be suitable. An IP code ILLIP (Illinois Integer Programming Code) is implemented based on the implicit enumeration by incorporating some new gimmicks such as pseudounderlining. Then the ILLIP is used to solve the IP problems for logical design by making use of the inherent structure of our problems. Various optimal networks are derived by a computer as follows: optimal NOR networks and optimal NOR-AND networks for all functions of up through three variables, one-bit adders with various gate types, and others. These results indicate the computational feasibility of the integer programming approach.","['Saburo Muroga', 'Toshihide Ibaraki']",13,"['0ddabecc-b78c-40c0-b232-bfc1811a6705', '209cc2b5-49c5-4672-b177-d2f52715c3a8', '33f80024-04bb-41de-a4a4-79e174ae8445', '4d16ba48-99a6-46f5-8df6-3c66377b988b', '7d6aadca-b3af-47a5-953b-18d380f19722', '9dfb99c9-b625-40da-8e25-0b5652617ae6', 'd17b523f-108e-40ea-8125-4932583f86c1', 'f7e5722d-6136-4135-9735-9fb0b5697b59']",Design of Optimal Switching Networks by Integer Programming,IEEE Transactions on Computers,1972,c1359d3f-41d7-4bc7-8eec-ab9538117040

A method for the analysis and synthesis of closed curves in the plane is developed using the Fourier descriptors FD's of Cosgriff [1]. A curve is represented parametrically as a function of arc length by the accumulated change in direction of the curve since the starting point. This function is expanded in a Fourier series and the coefficients are arranged in the amplitude/phase-angle form. It is shown that the amplitudes are pure form invariants as well as are certain simple functions of phase angles. Rotational and axial symmetry are related directly to simple properties of the Fourier descriptors. An analysis of shape similarity or symmetry can be based on these relationships; also closed symmetric curves can be synthesized from almost arbitrary Fourier descriptors. It is established that the Fourier series expansion is optimal and unique with respect to obtaining coefficients insensitive to starting point. Several examples are provided to indicate the usefulness of Fourier descriptors as features for shape discrimination and a number of interesting symmetric curves are generated by computer and plotted out.,"['Charles T.

"We are interested in estimating the moments of the spectral density of a comp[ex Gaussian signal process \{ q^{(1)} (t) \} when the signal process is immersed in independent additive complex Gaussian noise \{q^{(2)} (t) \} . Using vector samples Q = \{ q(t_1),\cdots ,q(t_m)\} , where q(t) = q^{(1)}(t) + q^{(2)}(t) , estimators for determining the spectral moments or parameters of the signal-process power spectrum may be constructed. These estimators depend upon estimates of the covariance function R_1 (h) of the signal process at only one value of h \neq 0 . In particular, if m = 2 , these estimators are maximum-likelihood solutions. (The explicit solution of the likelihood equations for m > 2 is still an unsolved problem.) using these solutions, asymptotic (with sample size) formulas for the means and variances of the spectral mean frequency and spectral width are derived. It is shown that the leading term in the variance computations is identical with the Cramer-Rao lower bound calculated using the Fisher information matrix. Also considered is the case Where the data set consists of N samples Of continuous data, each of finite duration.

"This paper is concerned with finding the optimal way of rearranging items in a warehouse from their initial positions to their desired final locations. Such a rearrangement may become necessary because of changes in the relative demand for each item, with the result that what were once fast-moving items at the front end of the warehouse, are now only slow-moving ones that must be moved towards the ""rear."" Although the problem, as treated in this paper, is addressed to the rearrangement of items in a warehouse, many other applications come immediately to mind, such as the reorganization of the layout of open-plan offices and factories. The paper gives a two-stage algorithm that produces the sequence of item movements necessary to achieve the desired rearrangement and incur the minimum cost or time spent in the rearranging process; the result is optimal in the restricted case where the rearrangement must be done in a number of cycles each one being of a short time duration the case, for example, if the warehouse were to remain operative during the rearrangement.","['Nicos Christofides', 'I.

"A new method based on a closure partition over a set of some compatibles is proposed for selecting a minimal machine from mutualy independent closure aggregates by simply checking only the trivial covering condition. The closure aggregates are derived from some closure related classes. The latter classes are derived from the closure classes by replacing aU superseded elements with their greatest superseding ones. The compatibles to be considered are some subsets of maximum compatibles related under the state transition or the set inclusion. Closure dependent classes may contain superseded and redundant compatibles but their corresponding closure aggregates have only unsuperseded and irredundant elements. Both of them are closed. However, some closure related class may not be closed and may contain some redundant elements. The remaining unrelated subsets of maximum compatibles are ignored. Superseded or redundant compatibles when they are so determined are also ignored.

"A new type of nonlinear filter, called the E -filter, is introduced that involves a transformation of the independent variable of the input function. It is shown how an E -filter can be designed to filter out superimposed ""noise"" on a signal, leaving the large peaks of the signal unattenuated. Unlike a Iow-pass linear filter, the low-pass E -filter is almost frequency independent and so does not affect the amplitudes of large sharp peaks of the signal. It is shown that the E -filter can be realized in real time and that a wide class of E -filters have a filtering action which is independent of the dc level of the input signal.","['Douglas J. H.

"During the compiling process, certain name resolutions must be made to ascertain whether a particular name has been used previously. If it has been used previously, the attributes this particular name possesses must be noted for use during the execution process. If the name has not been used previously, we assign default attributes. In some block structured languages, such as the procedural languages PL/I and ALGOL, a declaration of a name is made and there is a certain well-defined region of the program over which the declaration is applicable. This region is called the scope of the name established by the declaration. In general, distinct declarations of the same identifier imply distinct names with non-overlapping scopes. In some internal blocks, names are used without being explicitly declared. As a result, situations arise in which a resolution is required to establish the scope of a particular name.   The resolution of a name can occur at compile time or at execution time and these are the static and dynamic cases respectively. In the static case during compilation of a higher level source, the scope of the name must be resolved, using some algorithm which ascertains whether the name is used in another block.   This “naming problem” is one which must be resolved quite frequently during the compiling processes and it appears very attractive, therefore, to develop an architecture which can reduce the speed required to effect this resolution.   It is the purpose of this work to suggest such an architecture. We propose, herein, how a microprogrammed architecture can be applied to the problem described above, that is, the “naming problem” for static identification. We will show the advantages which accrue from such an architecture.   A microprogramming simulator is described, which permits the encoding and de-bugging of the micro-code used to effect the name resolution. We encode the name resolution algorithm in a higher level language consisting of interpretively driven operations which are not tied to any specific instruction set. These instructions, combined with push-down and pop-up stacks, are particularly suited to the translation process. In order to execute each of the operations, an interpretive technique is employed where-by an op-code is fetched and a branch is taken to microprogrammed routines resident in control memory.",['Stanley Habib'],50,['1bfa8811-7ed4-4bb5-a6fd-41a35b4f9021'],Name resolutions using a microprogrammed interpretive technique,international symposium on microarchitecture,1973,6103ad82-162a-408b-9a54-bb84786e18a6

"By plotting the key value against the record position in a sorted file and then fitting a least squares polynomial through the points, a fast retrieval technique is determined. The target key of a search is inserted in the polynomial and the first access from the file is made on the basis of the evaluation. Since the maximum deviation can be determined, an efficient local search can be made. If the maximum deviation is less than half the size of the file, polynomial searching is more efficient than binary searching.

"This paper describes the techniques used to implement an efficient virtual machine facility within MTS for the IBM System/360 Model 67. The goals of the project were to support the IBM Operating System, including the Indexed Sequential Access Method and Teleprocessing capabilities, as a subsystem under MTS with a maximum teleprocessing degradation of 30% for OS/360 programs and complete protection between OS/360 and MTS. The first attempt, using channel program relocation similar to that employed by CP-67, provided unacceptable response to teleprocessing requests which required indexed accesses to the data base. The second attempt obviated the need for most software relocation of channel programs by assuring that the OS/360 buffer areas and channel programs were allocated to main storage having addresses identical to their virtual addresses. Storage protection was accomplished by a hardware change to the IBM System/360 protection mechanism which created a two-level hierarchy of storage keys. Using these techniques the virtual machine met the goals of the project. The techniques employed are applicable to virtual memory systems other than MTS and the IBM System/360 Model 67","['Ronald J.

"A new approach is presented for the design of multiple fault detection tests in which the structure of a combinational circuit is used to reduce the number of input combinations required. The structure is defined by the interconnection of the basic elements, each of arbitrary complexity. The fault model assumes that the functions realized by the basic elements may undergo any deviation whatsoever, but that the circuit structure is fault free. Thus, arbitrary combinations of multiple faults within one or more basic elements are included in the model. Decomposition theory can be used to verify that a set of input combinations is a multiple fault detection test set under this model. A process called expansion will be introduced to simplify this task. A well-defined procedure is given for deriving a suitable test set which for some circuits is minimal or near minimal. It will yield a multiple fault detection test of length less than 2 n  for any circuit with a nontrivial nondisjoint decomposition, defined by a basic-element partition. Higher order basic-element partitions are introduced as a generalization. An upper bound is given on the length of a multiple fault detection test for any circuit with a given structure, independent of the function realized on the structure. The bound is tighter when function information is also used.","['Min-Wen Du', 'C.

"Since its debut in the late sixties, magnetic bubble technology has quickly evolved to become a promising alternative to semiconductor technology for computer construction. While emphasis has been placed upon the application of bubble technology to storage, its application to logic has thus far been largely limited to the implementation of simple basic operators, such as AND, OR, etc. An exception is the excellent work recently reported in References 12 and 13. This limitation to simple basic operators, however, is not in keeping with the high density and low connectivity requirements of LSI (Large-Scale Integration), and it has become increasingly important to find powerful multi-input switching functions. The symmetric function is a natural candidate. The realization of symmetric functions using magnetic bubble technology has been found to be very simple.","['Henry Chang', 'Tien Chi Chen', 'Chin Tung']",50,['8cebc1da-6a32-4752-86f7-70ef920edc53'],The realization of symmetric switching functions using magnetic bubble technology,,1973,8380f1de-d866-488e-b599-45c6809408a8

"Any finite information source is given a graph structure, in which two vertices are adjacent whenever the two corresponding source letters are distinguishable by the coder-decoder pair. Usual sources correspond, therefore, to complete graphs. If the associated graph is not complete, however, an \varepsilon -code for the source can be constructed in two steps: in the first, distinct codewords are given to distinguishable letters only; in the second step, a similar encoding is carried out for the complementary graph, in which distinguishable letters become indistinguishable and the converse. A particularly simple case shows up when nonadjacency is an equivalence relation among the vertices of the graph: each class of nondistinguishable letters can then be considered as a letter in a coarser source alphabet. The two-step procedure is then particularly intuitive. A problem arises when this procedure does not destroy optimality of the resulting \varepsilon -code; some partial results are given in this direction. The results obtained are largely based on some graph-theoretical ideas and tools.","['János Körner', 'Giuseppe O.

Neighborhood search has been used with some success in providing approximate solutions to discrete optimization problems. The technique produces solutions which may be locally but not globally optimal. For a particular class of problems this paper describes a method for analyzing the relative effectiveness associated with different neighborhoods in terms of the probability that a local optimum is in fact global. The analysis is then applied to the 5-city Travelling Salesman Problem for which two neighborhoods of like size are compared. It is found that local optimality with respect to one of these neighborhoods is roughly twice as likely to indicate global optimality as is local optimality with respect to the other. It is felt that further development of the techniques described in this paper might lead to computer designed heuristics for certain discrete optimization problems.,['Sam Savage'],1,[],Statistical indicators of optimality,foundations of computer science,1973,7b1ae221-4e2f-44fe-b7e6-9c41ba9c39fa

"An approach for bringing semantic, as well as syntactic, information to bear on the problem of theorem-proving search for Question-Answering (QA) Systems is descrilsed. The approach is embodied in a search algorithm, the Q* search algorithm, developed to control deductive searches in an experimental system. The Q* algorithm is part of a system, termed the Maryland Refutation Proof Procedure System (MRPPS), which incorporates both the Q* algorithm, which performs the search required to answer a query, and an inferential component, which performs the logical manipulations necessary to deduce a clause from one or two other clauses.

"Most graphics systems using a raster scan output device (CRT or hardcopy) maintain a display file in the XY or random scan format. Scan converters, hardware or software, must be provided to translate the picture description from the XY format to the raster format. Published scan conversion algorithms which are fast will reserve a buffer area large enough to accommodate the entire screen. On the other hand, those which use a small buffer area are slow because they require multiple passes through the XY display file. The scan conversion algorithm described here uses a linked list data structure to process the lines of the drawing in strips corresponding to groups of scan lines. A relatively small primary memory buffer area is used to accumulate the binary image for a group of scan lines. When this portion of the drawing has been plotted, the buffer is reused for the next portion. Because of the list processing procedures used, only a single pass through the XY display file is required when generating the binary image and only a slight increase in execution time over the fully buffered core results. Results show that storage requirements can be reduced by more than 80 percent while causing less than a 10 percent increase in execution time.","['Borimir Jordan', 'Ronald Curtis Barrett']",50,"['08042589-ac00-4452-adb7-365608787558', 'be742627-beb5-4aa4-ba3c-34b7342af6ae']",A scan conversion algorithm with reduced storage requirements,Communications of The ACM,1973,dc2a9d22-ed46-4ab4-8cdc-3ff48955431b

"Universal coding is any asymptotically optimum method of block-to-block memoryless source coding for sources with unknown parameters. This paper considers noiseless coding for such sources, primarily in terms of variable-length coding, with performance measured as a function of the coding redundancy relative to the per-letter conditional source entropy given the unknown parameter. It is found that universal (i.e., zero redundancy) coding in a weighted sense is possible if and only if the per-letter average mutual information between the parameter space and the message space is zero. Universal coding is possible in a maximin sense if and only if the channel capacity between the two spaces is zero. Universal coding is possible in a minimax sense if and only if a probability mass function exists, independent of the unknown parameter, for which the relative entropy of the known conditional-probability mass-function is zero. Several examples are given to illustrate the ideas. Particular attention is given to sources that are stationary and ergodic for any fixed parameter although the whole ensemble is not. For such sources, weighted universal codes always exist if the alphabet is finite, or more generally if the entropy is finite. Minimax universal codes result if an additional entropy stability constraint is applied. A discussion of fixed-rate universal coding is also given briefly with performance measured by a probability of error.",['Lee D.

"This paper considers the problem of the detection of a binary phase-modulated carrier which has been transmitted along with noise through a hard-limiting repeater, corrupted by additional noise, and demodulated by cross correlation and sampling at the receiver. Three equivalent expressions are obtained for the error probability of the receiver output. Two of these expressions take the form of an infinite series involving either confluent hypergeometric functions or modified Bessel functions. A third form allows representation of the error probability in terms of Rice's Ie function. In the special case where the signal-to-noise ratios \rho_1^2 and \rho_2^2 at the limiter and receiver inputs are equal, the error probability is simply \begin{equation} P_e = \frac{1}{2} \exp (-p_1^2). \end{equation} Asymptotic expressions for the error probability for large and small signal-to-noise ratios are also derived. The error probability is found to be smaller than that of a linear system for all practical values of limiter and receiver input signal-to-noise ratios. The optimum repeater non-linearity is investigated and is shown to be a limiter at such signal-to-noise ratios.","['Pravin C. Jain', 'Nelson M.

"A new nonparametric method of estimating the Bayes risk using an unclassified test sample set as well as a classified design sample set is introduced. The classified design set is used to obtain nonparametric estimates of the conditional Bayes risk of classification at each point of the unclassified test set. The average of these risk estimates is the error estimate. For large numbers of design samples the new error estimate has less variance than does an error-count estimate for classified test samples using the optimum Bayes classifier. The first application of the nonparametric method uses k -nearest neighbor ( k -NN) estimates of the posterior probabilities to form the risk estimate. A large-sample analysis is made of this estimate. The expected value of this estimate is shown to be a lower bound on the Bayes error. A simple modification provides unbiased estimates of the k -NN classification error, thus providing an upper bound on the Bayes error. The second application of the method uses Parzen approximation of the density functions to obtain estimates of the risk and subsequently the Bayes error. Results of experiments on simulated data illustrate the small-sample behavior.","['Keinosuke Fukunaga', 'David L.

"This paper presents an approach to achieve high central processing unit (CPU) availability with an increase in performance by multiprocessing on an instruction stream level, where instruction fetching/executing is done by closely coupled processing units (PU's). A treatment is given of the necessary control for coordination of the PU's. This processing interaction is accomplished by microcode shared by the units. Either PU can be interchanged in any processing function, and the total processing complex comprises a single CPU as far as the external world (i. e., the operating system and user's programs) is concerned. The results of manual simulation on two sample problems are given along with a comparison of processing with a single PU and with another instruction stream multiprocessing scheme presented in [4].","['Jerome M.

Because the hypothetical methodology is impractical, compromise methods are outlined and their underlying simplifying assumptions are discussed. The more plausible the simplifying assumptions on which a performance measure is based, the better the measure.

"Recursive least-squares estimates for processes that can be generated from finite-dimensional linear systems are usually obtained via an n \times n matrix Riccati differential equation, where n is the dimension of the state space. In general, this requires the solution of n(n + 1)/2 simultaneous nonlinear differential equations. For constant parameter systems, we present some new algorithms that in several cases require only the solution of less than 2np or n(m + p) simultaneous nonlinear differential equations, where m and p are the dimensions of the input and observation processes, respectively. These differential equations are said to be of Chandrasekhar type, because they are similar to certain equations introduced in 1948 by the astrophysicist S. Chandrasekhar, to solve finite-interval Wiener-Hopf equations arising in radiative transfer. Our algorithms yield the gain matrix for the Kalman filter directly without having to solve separately for the error-covariance matrix and potentially have other computational benefits. The simple method used to derive them also suggests various extensions, for example, to the solution of nonsymmetric Riccati equations.",['Thomas Kailath'],223,"['05c383c9-7a61-4e87-aa08-8cc9d2a8a195', '637a1dfc-bccd-4e2d-b6ac-a1f720a09e24', 'd1214d06-95c5-4ce5-a7da-72be8c48ab29']",Some new algorithms for recursive estimation in constant linear systems,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,1973,a983fa05-a879-4bf9-aadb-25ed24746922

"An attempt is made to characterize the usefulness of terms occurring in stored documents and user queries as a function of their frequency characteristics across the documents of a collection. It is found that the best terms are those having medium frequency in the collection and skewed frequency distributions. Correspondingly, terms exhibiting either very high or very low document frequency are not as useful. To improve the indexing vocabulary, it becomes necessary to group low frequency terms into classes, and to break up high frequency terms by forming phrases. An indexing theory is described based on term frequency considerations, and a new phrase generation method is introduced.

Formulas expressing this error matrix in terms of the optimal transfer function are established, and in the nonsingular case the optimal transfer function is expressed in terms of the spectral densities.

"In this paper we develop a model which represents the addressing of resources by processes executing on a virtual machine. The model distinguishes two maps: the o-map which represents the map visible to the operating system software running on the virtual machine, and the f-map which is invisible to that software but which is manipulated by the virtual machine monitor running on the real machine. The o-map maps process names into resource names and the f-map maps virtual resource names into real resource names. Thus, a process running on a virtual machine addresses its resources under the composed map f o o. In recursive operation, f maps from one virtual machine level to another and we have f o f o ... o f o o.   The model is used to describe and characterize previous virtual machine designs. We also introduce and illustrate a general approach for implementing virtual machines which follows directly from the model. This design, the Hardware Virtualizer, handles all process exceptions directly within the executing virtual machine without software intervention. All resource faults (VM-faults) generated by a virtual machine are directed to the appropriate virtual machine monitor without the knowledge of processes on the virtual machine (regardless of the level of recursion).",['Robert P.

"Since the birth of rate-distortion theory with the landmark paper of Shannon, research has centered on the extension of his theory to new situations and on the calculation of rate-distortion functions. Comparatively little has been done toward developing efficient algorithms for encoding information sources at rates near Shannon's rate-distortion limit. This paper reports one such algorithm, the 2-cycle algorithm, used with randomly chosen tree codes. In analyzing the 2-cycle algorithm, we present the first theoretical analysis of a realizable algorithm for tree coding of sources with a fidelity criterion. The algorithm may prove to be the first practical method of coding whose design actually derives from rate-distortion theory. Analysis proceeds by bounding methods related to difference equations and branching processes. Upper bounds on average distortion and encoding work are obtained and the latter are shown bounded as long as the coding rate exceeds Shannon's rate-distortion function. Of particular interest is the stack-searched branching process bound of Section IV. The two cycles of the algorithm are described fully in terms of expectations and probabilities, and recursions are listed to compute these quantities. Concluding the paper is numerical analysis, by theory and by simulation, with respect to the binary i.i.d, source and Hamming distortion measure. These numerical results are sufficient to optimize the algorithm over its free parameters.","['John B.

"Virtual machine systems have been implemented on a limited number of third generation computer systems, for example CP-67 on the IBM 360/67. The value of virtual machine techniques to ease the development of operating systems, to aid in program transferability, and to allow the concurrent running of disparate operating systems, test and diagnostic programs has been well recognized. However, from previous empirical studies, it is known that many third generation computer systems, e.g. the DEC PDP-10, cannot support a virtual machine system.   In this paper, the hardware architectural requirements for virtual machine systems are discussed. First, a fairly specific definition of a virtual machine is presented which includes the aspects of efficiency, isolation, and identical behavior. A model of third generation-like computer systems is then developed. The model includes a processor with supervisor and user modes, memory that has a simple protection mechanism, and a trap facility. In this context, instruction behavior is then carefully characterized.","['Gerald J. Popek', 'Robert P.

"For several years, there has been discussion about the use of the  goto  statement in programming languages [1, 2]. It has been pointed out that  goto  free programs tend to be easier to understand, allow better optimization by the compiler, and are better suited for an eventual proof of correctness. On the other hand, the  goto  statement is a flexible tool for many programmers. Most programming languages have constructs which allow the programmer to write control flows that occur frequently without the use of a  goto . In particular, the language Pascal [3] contains, besides the  goto , the following control structures:  if-then-else ,  case ,  while-do ,  repeat-until , stepping loop.

A compatibility relation on the column vectors of the decomposition chart is introduced, which is applied to identify all possible simple disjunctive decompositions for each input partition. The assignments of the DON'T CARE (φ) conditions that are required to realize these simple decompositions are described by a vector listing the constraints on these φ's by new Boolean variables caled constrained DON'T CAREs. A compatibility relation is introduced on these vectors, caled constrained Boolean vectors, which is applied to form complete decompositions. A Complete decomposition is one for which al possible simple decompositions have been combined into a complex decomposition. Throughout the procedure, the freedom of choice implied by the φ's is maintained as far as is alllowed by the choices that have been made to achieve the decompositions.",['S.L.

"The doubly-compound hypothesis detection problem with finite-dimensional parameter vectors is treated in a general context. It is shown that estimation and detection occur simultaneously, with the detector using the a posteriori densities generated by two separate estimators, one for each hypothesis. No assumptions are made on the estimation criterion and very loose assumptions on the detection cfiterion. If sufficient statistics and hence natural conjugate densities exist for the unknown parameters, the procedure is quite tractable. In this case, the optimal detector partitions in such a way that the primary processing can be done without knowledge of the a priori parameter distributions.","['Theodore G. Birdsall', 'J. O.

"If one projects the growth of computer communication networks like the ARPANET to a worldwide situation, satellite communication is attractive for intercommunicating between the widespread geographic areas. For this variable demand, multi-station, data traffic situation, satellites are uniquely qualified in that they are theoretically capable of statistically averaging the load in total at the satellite rather than requiring each station or station-pair to average the traffic independently. However, very little research has been done on techniques which permit direct multi-station demand access to a satellite for data traffic. For voice traffic statistics, COMSAT Laboratories has developed highly efficient techniques; the SPADE system currently installed in the Atlantic permitting the pooled use of 64KB PCM voice channels on a demand basis, and the MAT-1 TDMA (Time Division Multiple-Access) experimental system. Both systems permit flexible demand assignment of the satellite capacity, but on a circuit-switched basis designed to interconnect a full duplex 64KB channel between two stations for minutes rather than deliver small blocks of data here and there. This work forms the technical base for advanced digital satellite communication, and provides a very effective means for moving large quantities of data between two points.

We present a new derivation of the source coding theorem for discrete-time sources. This proof parallels Gallager's [1] derivation of the random coding bound for channel coding theory and shows that the classical random coding exponent also emerges as a critical quantity for source coding. The major advantage of this approach is the simplicity of the derivation and its close relationship to the more familiar channel coding theory. The source coding theorem we derive here also yields a natural bound on the rate of convergence to the rate-distortion limit.,['Jim K.

"A notion of one computable function (not) helping the computation of another is defined in terms of the lattices of honest subrecursive classes. It is said that two honest computable functions do not help each other's computation if the intersection (meet) of the subrecursive classes which they generate is the zero subrecursive class; that is, two functions do not help each other's computation if they have trivial information content in common. One honest subrecursive class is said to be the pseudo-complement of another if it is the maximum class which has trivial information content in common with the other. A technical characterization is given of those honest subrecursive classes for which there are non-zero honest subrecursive classes with trivial information content in common with them. Further, it is shown that for every non-zero honest subrecursive class there is an effective, increasing sequence of honest subrecursive classes which have trivial information content in common with it, and this sequence is cofinal upwards with the set of all honest subrecursive classes which have trivial information content in common with it.

"This paper presents an algorithm for solving resource-constrained network scheduling problems, a general class of problems that includes the classical job-shop-scheduling problem. It uses Lagrange multipliers to dualize the resource constraints, forming a Lagrangian problem in which the network constraints appear explicitly, while the resource constraints appear only in the Lagrangian function. Because the network constraints do not interact among jobs, the problem of minimizing the Lagrangian decomposes into a subproblem for each job. Algorithms are presented for solving these subproblems. Minimizing the Lagrangian with fixed multiplier values yields a lower bound on the cost of an optimal solution to the scheduling problem. The paper gives procedures for adjusting the multipliers iteratively to obtain strong bounds, and it develops a branch-and-bound algorithm that uses these bounds in the solution of the scheduling problem.

"A generalization of the resolution method for higher order logic is presented. The languages acceptable for the method are phrased in a theory of types of order  w  (all finite types)—including the λ-operator, propositional functors, and quantifiers. The resolution method is, of course, a machine-oriented theorem search procedure based on refutation. In order to make this method suitable for higher order logic, it was necessary to overcome two sorts of difficulties. The first is that the unifying substitution procedure—an essential feature of the classic first-order resolution—must be generalized (it is noted that for the higher order unification the proper notion of substitution will include λ-normalization). A general unification algorithm is produced and proved to be complete for second-order languages. The second difficulty arises because in higher order languages, semantic intent is essentially more “interwoven” in formulas than in first-order languages. Whereas quantifiers could be eliminated immediately in first-order resolution, their elimination must be deferred in the higher order case. The generalized resolution procedure which the author produces thus incorporates quantifier elimination along with the familiar features of unification and tautological reduction. It is established that the author's generalized resolution procedure is complete with respect to a natural notion of validity based on Henkin's general validity for type theory.

The performance of the codes is evaluated using the union bound on the error probability as a performance measure. The union bound is shown to be closely related to the moments of the scalar product between the code vectors. Commutative group codes are described. It is shown that linear algebraic codes may be represented as commutative group codes. The code class is also shown to include simplex and biorthogonal codes in all dimensions.",['Ingemar Ingemarsson'],50,['a070da21-97cd-439a-ac86-edb00d6966c1'],Commutative group codes for the Gaussian channel,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,1973,5680b36d-7c77-4cd0-b192-c9d8d081a967

"A technique is presented for global analysis of program structure in order to perform compile time optimization of object code generated for expressions. The global expression optimization presented includes constant propagation, common subexpression elimination, elimination of redundant register load operations, and live expression analysis. A general purpose program flow analysis algorithm is developed which depends upon the existence of an ""optimizing function."" The algorithm is defined formally using a directed graph model of program flow structure, and is shown to be correct. Several optimizing functions are defined which, when used in conjunction with the flow analysis algorithm, provide the various forms of code optimization. The flow analysis algorithm is sufficiently general that additional functions can easily be defined for other forms of global code optimization.",['Gary A.

"The design of totally self-checking check circuits for m-out-of-n codes is described. Totally self-checking m-out-of-n checkers provide an error indication whenever the input is not an m-out-of-n code or whenever a fault occurs within the checker itself. Since the checker checks itself, there is no need for additional maintenance access or periodic exercise of the checker to verify its ability to detect errors. The basic structure of the checker relies on the use of majority detection circuits. Various gate level implementations for the majority detection circuits are also presented, although the self-checking capability of the checker does not depend on their particular implementation since they are exhaustively tested by code inputs. The self-testing checkers for k-out-of-2k codes are discussed in the most detail since the totally self-checking checkers for 1-out-of-n and arbitrary m-out-of-n codes are constructed by first translating the code to a k-out-of-2k code via a totally self-checking translator.","['Douglas A.

"A system of programs is described for the detection of the straight edge lines in simple scenes. Distinct lines are detected by a procedure that is relatively inexpensive. The more subtle lines are then located by a search that is much more costly per unit area, but which is only applied to certain areas suggested by the locations of the lines already found. The considerable efficiency of this approach to edge detection is discussed both theoretically and in relation to the performance of the present system.

"A combined manual and decision task may be viewed as an arrangement of subtasks, one or more of which involves uncertainty due to some input random process I(X). Very little is known about the relationship between the subtask performance times and I(X), particularly in an operational environment. An experiment was run involving a task containing a 4-alternative choice decision subtask. The other subtasks involved motions that have been found to be typical of many operational environments. The probabilistic conditions that were varied over the 4-alternative choice element consisted of six discrete probability functions for each of two distinct structures: independent (random sequences) and Markov dependent. The subtask performance time distributions were found to fit gamma's, but tended to independent approximate normal variates as subjects progressed toward fully learned states. For fully learned subjects the only subtask affected by the uncertainty was the decision subtask, and these effects did not vary significantly between the independent and Markov structures. Subjects employed a motion strategy at the decision subtask that was a function of the most probable stimulus. The results provide factors pertinent to systems design and evaluation in general.",['Marlin U.

At the heart of a number of arithmetic complexity problems are some basic questions in tensor analysis. Questions regarding the complexity of multiplication operations which are n-linear are most easily studied in a tensor analytic framework. Certain results of tensor analysis are used in this paper to provide insight into the solution of some of these problems. Methods are given to determine a partial ordering on the set of tensors corresponding to a partial ordering with respect to complexity on the set of n-linear operations. Different classes of algorithms for evaluating n - linear operations are studied and a generalized cost criterion is used. Algorithms are given for determining the rank of a class of third order tensors and a canonical form for such tensors is presented. Bounds on the complexity of a wide class of operations are also derived.,['David P.

"This paper describes a class of partitioning networks, called banyans, whose cost function grows more slowly than that of the crossbar and whose fan-out requirements are independent of network size. Such networks can economically partition the resources of large modular systems into a wide variety of subsystems. Any possible partition can be realized by paralleling several networks or by multiplexing a single network in a manner to be described later. Results will be given indicating that a cost/performance advantage over the crossbar can be obtained for large systems and that the crossbar can, in fact, be considered a non-optimal special case of a banyan network. Inherent fail-soft capability and the existence of rapid control algorithms which can be largely performed by distributed logic within the network are also important attributes of banyans.

"Mathematical modeling of phrase structure grammars has yielded many results of benefit to linguists in their investigation of these grammars, such as Chomsky’s characterization in terms of self-embedding of those context-free languages which are not regular. The recent shift of focus in linguistic theory to transformational grammars has not been accompanied by a similar application of mathematical techniques to transformations. Our present purpose is to foster such studies by providing general definitions which model grammatical transformations as mappings on trees (equivalently, labeled bracketings) and investigating questions of current linguistic interest, such as the recursiveness of languages generated by transformational grammars. The first result of our research is that, despite the linguistically motivated, complex restrictions placed on transformational grammars, every recursively enumerable set of strings is a transformational language (Theorem 5.1). We demonstrate that this power of transformational grammars to generate non-recursive languages results from their ability to cycle their rules, applying transformations an unbounded number of times (Corollary 6.6). Analysis of decision procedures for grammars with bounded cycling reveals a connection between the amount of cycling permitted by a grammar and the complexity of the recursive set it generates; if cycling is bounded by any elementary recursive function (primitive recursive function, function in &? for n > 3), then the language generated has characteristic function in the same class (Corollary 6.7). One application of these results provides empirical support for the notion that natural languages are recursively, in fact elementarily, decidable. Our results also isolate one feature which must be further restricted in a linguistically motivated way if transformational theory is to achieve its goal of delimiting precisely the natural languages.","['P.

"1. The Junction Grammar Model of Language. Junction Grammar is a generative grammar with multiple levels of representation. The deep level is a nonlexical conceptual level, where the meaning of a segment of discourse is represented by a set of intersecting branching trees, each tree consisting of conceptual units (or sememes) and junctions. 1 The junction patterns (whence the name, Junction Grammar) are selected from a finite language-independent pool, and are used to describe the relationships between the sememes. The basic concepts of Junction Grammar were developed at Brigham Young University by Dr. Eldon G. Lytle from 1968 to 1970, but significant refinements to the theory continue to be added. We will first examine the Junction Grammar model of language, then the model of translation suggested by the model of language, and finally an application of the model to mechanical translation or, as we prefer to term it, computer-assisted translation. The Junction Grammar model distinguishes four levels of representation (see Fig. 1). Level I is the real world, where objects represent themselves. Level II is the conceptual level at which we postulate that a person has a pool of base sememes from which he draws to form segments of discourse by the application of junction rules. These sememes correspond to a particular meaning of a word, phrase, or part of a word at level IV. At level II, we call a meaningful segment of discourse a “Well-Formed Syntacto-semantic Statement” or WFSS (pronounced /wufəsəs/). A WFSS is a statement about the syntax which joins a set of concepts to form a segment of discourse. This level II syntax is not to be confused with surface syntax, which deals with such matters as word order.

The problem becomes especially annoying when one is examining the memory dump of the word contents of a machine which has a byte size not divisible by three (e.g., PDP-11). In such cases some of the octal digits contain portions of neighboring bytes. For example, in the octal representation of a 16-bit word made up of two 8-bit bytes the third digit from the right contains two bits of the right-hand byte and one bit of the left-hand byte.

In this paper the process for staffing services is divided into three decision levels: a policy decisions, including the operating procedures for service centers and for the staff-control process itself; b staff planning, including hiring, discharge, training, and reallocation decisions; and c short-term scheduling of available staff within the constraints determined by the two previous levels. These three planning ""levels"" are used as decomposition stages in developing a general staffing model. The paper formulates the planning and scheduling stages as a stochastic programming problem, suggests an iterative solution procedure using random loss functions, and develops a noniterative solution procedure for a chance-constrained formulation that considers alternative operating procedures and service criteria, and permits including statistically dependent demands. The discussion includes an example application of the model and illustrations of its potential uses in the nurse-staffing process.","['William J. Abernathy', 'Nicholas Baloff', 'John C.

The Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition procedure for concave programs can be viewed as inner linearization followed by restriction. This paper presents an approach that allows selective inner linearization of functions and utilizes a generalized pricing problem. It allows considerable flexibility in the choice of functions to be approximated using inner linearization. Use of the generalized pricing problem guarantees that strict improvement in the value of the objective function is achieved at each iteration and provides a termination criterion that is both necessary and sufficient for optimality. A specialization of this procedure results in an algorithm that is a direct extension of the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition algorithm.,['Charles A.

It assumes the failure times of the units to be exponentially distributed with parameters λ and λ1, respectively. Initially, a unit is switched on and the other one is kept as a warm standby. The system breaks down if a unit fails while the other is still under repair. This paper characterizes the system by the probabilities of its being in the up or the down state, sets up integral equations for these probabilities by identifying suitable regenerative stochastic processes, and employs the Laplace-transform technique to solve these equations. It obtains the mean down-time of the system during 0, t and the mean time to system failure explicitly.","['S. K. Srinivasan', 'M.N.

"A physicomathematical basis is used to establish bounds T D (n) on the time needed to compute n-argument functions by spatially distributed primitive devices or composite systems D. The axioms used concern the speed, packing density, and noise threshold of the energy with which any computing device detects or alters the physical representation of information. The principal result is that T D (n) grows at least as n 1/2 . Composite systems consisting of spatially distributed identical components are examined in light of this bound.

"Abstract#R##N##R##N#It was argued that the present-day thesaurus-construction and maintenance rules and conventions are not theoretically based. For this redson, there are few rules and conventions for updating a thesaurus. Consequently, most of the thesauri adopted by operating information storage and retrieval systems are not systematically updated. In order to investigate how thesauri are actually updated, a survey was conducted. The working hypothesis was that the communication process between authors and readers is linear in nature (“one-way” communication allowing no reciprocal feedback) if a thesaurus utilized in a system is not updated by both indexers and question negotiators. Findings show that thesauri viewed from the communications point of view do not allow a cybernetic process of communication (“both-way” communication). The survey indicated that the present practice of updating thesauri is largely done by indexers alone. No attempt was made to develop a theory of thesaurus-construction and updating. It was, however, argued that such a theory, if developed, should at least account for the concepts of meaning and knowledge. Within this theoretical framework, two techniques are suggested to be considered for the systematic updating of a thesaurus.",['Chai Kim'],10,['f8f0e191-5fea-4d19-936f-9340feb6378c'],Theoretical foundations of thesaurus‐construction and some methodological considerations for thesaurus‐updating,Journal of The American Society for Information Science,1973,f5a6f787-b9ff-4bff-9596-399ba5ce1d7e

"The effects of aural, visual, and combined displays on human tracking performance were evaluated by means of the critical tracking task which employs an unstable controlled element. Four visual displays and an aural display were used in this study. Values of ?c9, the critical root or maximum degree of instability, were developed for each display alone and also for the visual displays used in combination with the aural presentation. These experiments were motivated by the results of a previous study by the authors which indicated that combined displays might lead to improved performance. Tracking performance, as measured by ?c9, was consistently better for combined visual and aural presentations than for either type of display used alone. This trend was exhibited for each of the four visual displays and for both experienced and inexperienced trackers. These results suggested that combined displays supply greater net usable information to the human's central processor, allowing a significant reduction in estimation errors by the human operator. The effects of external disturbance input to the tracking loop were investigated. Tracking performance was degraded with increasing disturbance amplitude but no clear trends with bandwidth were noted.","['Edward T. Pitkin', 'Edward W.

"There are many reasons why microprogramming has become an essential architectural attribute in contemporary computers. It provides certain well-known design and manufacturing advantages. It also facilitates the emulation of other machine languages. It gives the user the opportunity to tailor instruction sets to suit his application environment. However, a number of difficulties arise when the user attempts to exploit the potential of microprogramming. When microprograms are stored in Read-Only Memories (ROM's), the advantage of dynamic modification of control information is lost at the microprogram level. Recent trends towards writable stores will obviate this disadvantage. Also, microinstruction coding (microcoding) of computers using horizontal or minimally encoded formats becomes a time consuming proposition.   In the foregoing sections we shall briefly review some high level languages for microcoding and develop a new language that provides an efficient way for detecting and locating parallel processable independent actions for possible representation in microinstruction.","['C.

"In designing a self-checking processor, it is essential to recognize the types of failures that are most probable. Matching the checking techniques with the type of faults that are expected to occur should yield the best result with the least amount of hardware. The microprogram control will consist of integrated circuits: large-scale integration (LSI) for the memory and small-scale integration (SSI) for the associated control logic. Because of the density of chips on a plug-in package and the physical proximity of the devices on an integrated circuit, multiple faults within a single circuit are highly probable. The types of faults within a circuit have been analyzed and found to be of the type which would tend to affect the bits in a unidirectional manner.

"This note focuses on two new and related cut strategies for integer programming: the ""convexity-cut"" and ""cut-search"" strategies. The fundamental notions underlying the convexity-cut approach are due to Richard D. Young and Egon Balas, whose ""hypercylindrical"" and ""intersection"" cuts provide the conceptual starting points for the slightly more general framework developed here. We indicate the utility of our framework and hence the importance of the original Young and Balas ideas by specifying a variety of new cuts that can be obtained from it. The second new strategy, cut search, shares with the convexity-cut strategy the notion of generating a cut by passing a hyper-plane through the terminal endpoints of edges extended from the vertex of a cone. However, whereas the convexity-cut approach determines the extensions of these edges by reference to a convex set that contains the vertex of the cone in its interior, the cut-search approach determines these extensions by reference to associations between certain ""proxy"" sets of points e.g., collections of hyperplanes and ""candidate solutions"" to the integer program. The cut-search approach typically involves more work than the convexity-cut approach, but offers the chance to identify feasible solutions in the process, and can sometimes also yield somewhat stronger cuts than the convexity cuts.",['Fred Glover'],91,"['0d33c19c-96ba-41a7-a71a-171119b61607', 'b4cee3a5-5b30-4184-b2ab-42013611da21']",Convexity Cuts and Cut Search,Operations Research,1973,73f4ac41-d2d2-4108-b983-8c4b96e32c77

It is shown that in order to implement linear recursion so as to execute in time n one does not need space proportional to n : ne for arbitrarily small e will do. It is also known that with constant space one can implement linear recursion in time n. We show that one can do much better : ne for arbitrarily small c. We also describe an algorithm that lies between these two: it takes time n.log(n) and space log(n).

The detector structure can be realized and detection thresholds set without prior knowledge of the WGN level. When the observation interval is large the detector has the structure of a spectral estimator-correlator, the output of which is compared to an adaptive threshold.

"Self-organizing probability state variable (PSV) parameter search algorithms possessing long-term memory have been formulated to cope with systems that must avoid high performance-penalty operating regions. The information gained from all previous experiments is efficiently encoded in multivariate probability distribution functions (pdf's). This long-term memory capability enables the PSV algorithms to avoid effectively future experiments in high penalty regions. The systems considered are resource-limited, and catastrophic failure may occur if parameter values lying in high penalty regions are implemented. Those cases in which the high penalty regions are not known in advance were investigated. The PSV algorithms have the capability of adaptively learning the location and hypervolume of these regions as the search proceeds. The algorithms are explicitly guided in their internal strategies as a function of the remaining system resources and the updated probability distribution functions. Clustering analysis is used both in the discovery of new operating regions and for updating the pdf's. As a by-product of this research, clustering was also investigated as a presearch scheme. It is shown that this procedure has great promise as a means of assessing the complexity of an optimization problem. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the utility of the self-organizing PSV search algorithms.",['Anthony N.

"A general method of constructing a drive workload representative of a real workload is described. The real workload is characterized by its demands on the various system resources. These characteristics of the real workload are obtained from the system accounting data. The characteristics of the drive workload are determined by matching the joint probability density of the real workload with that of the drive workload. The drive workload is realized by using a synthetic program in which the characteristics can be varied by varying the appropriate parameters. Calibration experiments are conducted to determine expressions relating the synthetic program parameters with the workload characteristics. The general method is applied to the case of two variables, cpu seconds and number of I/O activities; and a synthetic workload with 88 jobs is constructed to represent a month's workload consisting of about 6000 jobs.","['K.

"This paper describes a planning model designed to be used by managers of family-planning systems to improve understanding, forecasting, and planning. The macro-flow model describes the patient movement through post-partum and nonpost-partum programs. The flows model the phenomena of: outreach recruitment, continuance, post-partum checkups, switching methods, referral, migration, contraceptive-use experience, private protection, method effectiveness, advertising response, follow up, abortion, and medical services. Strategic variables can be linked to the flow parameters to produce capacity requirements and budgetary implications. The model output includes benefit measures of total active patients, couple years of protection, ""births protected,"" and unwanted births prevented. The fertility aspects of births prevented are modeled through a nonstationary Markov process submodel that considers demographic phenomena without burdening the basic flow structure. The input procedures used to process patient-visit, outreach, clinic-survey, and experimental data are discussed and some empirical results are reported. The combination of data-based estimates and subjective judgment is done by ""fitting"" the model to past observed data. Testing and control are done by ""tracking"" model performance through conditional prediction, diagnosis, and updating. The model is implemented in an on-line, conversational program that facilitates evolutionary model building by allowing the user to specify his model options. The application and testing of the model in the Atlanta Area Family Planning System are discussed and the experiences of managers in using the model to gain new insights, forecasts, budgets, and plans are reported.",['Glen L.

"This paper traces the various explorations which have been made to demonstrate the performance improvements which can be obtained by implementing the compiling, translation and execution of higher level languages. In most instances computer architecture is based on instruction set design and much of the high level language implementation is done by software compiling into the instruction set of the machine.   During the mid-1960's, several papers dealt with language performance improvements for FORTRAN or ALGOL machines. These discussions generally restricted themselves to a narrow problem in the entire spectrum of compilation problems. None address microprogrammed implementation of I/O functions for example. More recently we see the use of microprogram architecture for special purpose processors such as Fast Fourier Transform machines or array processors; speed ups for basic functions such as arithmetic calculations in Fortran.   With the possibility of microroutines to implement basic functions, there was a renewed interest in the Interpretive processes. This points up the need for a high level microprogramming language. We discuss some of the work done in this area. The area which has not yet been fully addressed is to what extent one can utilize microprogram architecture for basic design of an effective high level language machine. In this paper we will outline the earlier work vis a vis language enhancements and then suggest the areas which must be further explored.",['Stanley Habib'],2,"['1f98ff40-46fe-4660-ab8b-9dbccb2851bf', '3104fc5a-71f8-4928-a0c2-6b2feaf7d611', '4ebf9d74-b90b-4225-9d87-c480235d2c5a', '6103ad82-162a-408b-9a54-bb84786e18a6', '7cfff664-24a5-4af6-9489-e36be2ff109a', 'a202353c-0471-45e0-93f3-ab57dcae31f3', 'de4f44c8-879e-4485-ab68-29833f74bd53']",Microprogrammed enhancements to higher level languages - an overview,international symposium on microarchitecture,1974,cbe38800-9593-4fdf-9d1a-bb5b27cedeea

"A hierarchical queuing network is a layered network of queues in which all arrivals receive initial service from a primary server, and some customers receive additional service jointly from a primary and a secondary server. This paper considers the simplest such network, involving two levels and a single secondary server who functions as a consultant to several primary servers and always works in conjunction with the primary server who refers the customer to him. An approximate analysis of this hierarchical queuing network is carried out for three operating disciplines governing the consultation process. The analytical results compare favorably with the results of computer simulations and are therefore used to explore several important issues in the design of such networks.

"In the low-to-medium performance range of computer systems, the designer is faced with ever increasing input/output requirements which cannot be accommodated in the traditional way.   In the past as well in present day computers of sufficient internal performance the input/output part and the instruction execution part of a central processing unit are combined. In order to provide high input/output data rates on smaller machines, a multiprocessor system must be used. Different design alternatives are discussed using microprogram controlled processors. The paper focusses on a design, where dedicated processors for internal and external processing needs are combined with a maintenance processor and the memory system in a star-like configuration.   Microprogramming needs and hardware support vary widely in such a design. The central processor handling the internal tasks like instruction execution and interrupt processing requires the customary complex and powerful microinstruction repertoire. The processor for the external tasks - the input/output processor - performs all data transfers and executes channel programs. Here, realtime behavior is essential while the microinstruction set is fairly small and simple.   In dealing with these design principles, the realization of such a computer will be discussed as an example.",['Helmut Berndt'],1,[],A multi-microprocessor design,international symposium on microarchitecture,1974,b8f24a63-7943-420b-9563-dc3a81c73ae0

This linear placement algorithm is then extended to higher dimensions for placing uniform-size equipment modules at homogeneous fixed locations. The algorithm accommodates lower-bound constraints for the linear case efficiently and produces near-optimal solutions.

"This paper develops solutions to extensions of F. W. Lanchester's classical equations of “modern warfare” (frequently referred to as aimed-fire equations) for combat between two homogeneous forces. In these extensions the lethality of the fire (as expressed by the Lanchester attrition-rate coefficient) depends on time. When the dependence is arbitrary, the solution is an infinite series of recursively related integrals; in special cases, more convenient representations (including representation in terms of tabulated functions) are available. Solutions are obtained in the following cases: (1) the lethality of each side's fire proportional to a power of time and both lethalities initially zero, and (2) the lethality of each side's fire linear with time, but only one side's lethality initially zero. The latter case models the constant-speed approach between forces whose weapons have different maximum effective ranges.",['James G.

A new technique to modify any logic network to facilitate diagnosis is given. By providing extra controllable inputs (at most six) and observable outputs it is shown that any number of stuck-at-faults in a logic network can be detected by applying only three tests. This number is believed to be minimal for networks using current technologies. Example of logic module that can be used to realize any logic function such that only two tests detect stuck-at-faults is also given.,"['Kewal K. Saluja', 'Sudhakar M.

"A semantics of the ƛ-calculus is presented which is different from any of the lattice models, so far analysed, of Scott and the term models of Morris and Barendregt. The original motivation was to do for ƛ-expressions what Scott had done for flow-diagrams, namely construct a 'syntactic' inverse limit lattice, E∞ in which to represent them. .A further motivation was to abstract out the essential notion J(""continuous semantics"") behind the theorem that Wadsworth proved concerning some of Scott's models, namely that meaning of a ƛ-expression can be found as the (continuous) limit its approximate reductions. That this idea is relevant to E∞ can be seen since the coordinates , of the image of a ƛ-expression in E∞ .form a subset of its approximate reductions.#R##N##R##N#To establish the basic fact of s-modelship about E∞ be shown that Wadsworth's theorem does indeed apply - i.e. that the , it has to 3 E∞-coordinates provide a sufficiently complete subset of all the possible approximate reductions. Translating this back to the ƛ-calculus gives an algorithm (""i'th reductions"") for producing s-reductions which must be proven 'correct'  - i.e. that it goes sufficiently far in all cases, : this notion is christened ""weak completeness"". l'th reductions are generalised to a non-deterministic evaluation mechanism called ""inside-out reductions"" which behaves in almost the opposite manner to Church's ""standard reductions"". This generalisation is not too drastic since it is easy to show that a weak completeness result for one implies the same for the other. The weak completeness of inside-out reductions is established.#R##N##R##N#The E∞-semantics is a 'pure' a-model in that the only n-reductions modelled are when there are equivalent s-reductions - other-wise they are not even comparable. Further, ƛ-expressions with a normal form are maximal and isolated in E∞, unsolvable expressions are i,the fixed-point combinators {Yi|i > O} are equivalenced and the model itself is substitutive, normal, solvable and implies Morris' ""extensional equivalence"". Finally, it is the minimal continuous semantics in the sense that Wadsworth's theorem is true in another semantics if and only if it is continuously derivable from E∞",['Peter H.

"A new class of circuits called ""partially self-checking circuits"" is described. These circuits have one mode of operation called secure mode in which every fault is tested in normal operation and no fault can cause an undetected error. They also have an insecure mode of operation in which undetected errors can occur; however, every fault that can cause an error in insecure mode is tested by some input in secure mode. One application of these circuits is in the arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) of a computer with data encoded in an error-detecting code. While there is no code simpler than duplication which detects single errors in logical operations such as AND and OR, it is shown that there exist partially self-checking networks to perform these operations.

"A necessary and sufficient condition for a linear sequential circuit to possess a feedforward inverse is given. This condition for existence of a feedforward inverse is given in terms of the Markov parameters rather than the minors of the transfer function matrix of the linear sequential circuit as has been the case in previous studies on this problem. An upper bound on the required memory of a feedforward inverse for a linear sequential circuit is established in terms of n, the dimension of the state transition matrix and Lo, the inherent delay of the linear sequential circuit. When the original linear sequential circuit is itself feedforward, a stronger upper bound on the memory of a feedforward inverse is established in terms of u, the input memory, k, the number of inputs, and Lo. Both upper bounds on the required inverse memory are shown to be tight in the sense that for each set of possible values of the parameters entering the bound there exists at least one linear sequential circuit whose inverse requires input memory equal to the bound.

"Detection of concurrently executable microoperations is an important consideration for effective horizontal microprogramming. Since it is highly machine-dependent and requires knowledge of highly intricate features of a machine, only limited effort has been made so far to derive an algorithm for detection of microprogram parallelism to enable optimization of horizontal microprograms.   In this paper, problems involved in optimization of horizontal microprograms are described. Existing techniques are applied to detect microprogram parallelism in a sequential source microprogram to allow subsequent optimization of the microprogram in a horizontal format. An algorithm for optimization of horizontal microprograms is derived. An upper bound for microprogram execution time is determined. The results derived in this paper are very general so that they are applicable to any machine with a horizontal microinstruction format (including a vertical format which is a special case of a horizontal format).

"The development of a programming language for microprocessors (we will use the term microprocessor to refer to the hardware host to be microprogrammed) differs from the development of languages for conventional processors [5, 6]. The difference is traced to:   (1) concurrency of hardware   (2) limited writable local memory   (3) main memory access delay and I/0 control   (4) limited microprocessor instruction repertoire   (5) special hardware characteristics that impact heavily upon machine efficiency.   These features impose restrictions upon the compiler writer that have not been fully overcome [5, 6, 8, 10, 14]. Writable control memory, for example, places severe restrictions on the designer who wishes to implement a syntax driven compiler that produces many intermediate results that must be stored.    It is not the intention of this paper to advocate a solution to any of the five problems listed above or to propose a particular language design . Instead we will present a basic compilation model (see Figure 1) and briefly discuss some of the alternatives to be considered at each level of the model.   The discussion is broken into five areas: (a) syntax design, (b) phase I interface design, (c) intermediate language design, (d) phase II interface design, and (e) micro-instruction format considerations. In addition section 3 presents various arguments on timing and concurrency recognition.

In particular, we derive information rates and obtain rate-distortion relationships for practical data-compression schemes, for the reproduction of the unordered sequence of Poisson event occurrences, for the reproduction of the sample functions of the Poisson counting process, and for the reproduction of the sequence of intervals between the event occurrences of a Poisson process.

"Markov duels are a general class of stochastic duels in which each weapon has Markov-dependent fire, that is, the outcomes of shots by each weapon form a Markov process. This paper develops duel models for the situation in which the outcomes form a finite stationary Markov chain and both weapons have an unlimited supply of ammunition, fire at constant intervals of time, and duel until one is killed. Based on these assumptions, the probability of a given side winning the duel is obtained for two sets of starting conditions: 1 both weapons begin with unloaded weapons and have tactical equity, and 2 one weapon has the advantage of surprise and can fire y rounds at the other before the two-sided duel begins, where y is a random variable with a geometric distribution. The mean and variance of the number of rounds to kill a passive target are also derived and two example duels are solved. Finally, methods are indicated for obtaining the solution to a Markov duel between weapons having exponential firing times and either fixed, limited ammunition supplies or infinite supplies.",['C.

The men can all complete any job in an exponential amount of time, with mean l/u, but the men are of different known qualities. Once a man finishes a job he again becomes available to do future jobs. If a man of quality p is assigned to do a job whose value is observed to be x, a reward rp,x is received. Also a cost of cp is incurred per unit time that a man of quality p is kept idle. The decision maker must observe the values of the incoming jobs and assign them to available men so as to maximize expected reward per unit time.

"It is generally a problem to select the appropriate preprocessing and feature-extraction technique in most pictorial pattern recognition applications so that an accurate classification is possible. In this paper a class of pictures of medical importance, namely, chest X-ray pictures, is used to test the proposed preprocessing and feature-extraction technique. The technique presented in this paper is applied only to chest X-ray images; however, the same technique could also be applied to a fairly broad class of picture patterns with only some minor modifications. The proposed preprocessing technique, which utilizes the local and global information of the picture patterns, is to extract the lung boundary. The lung field is then enclosed by a polygon which is the piecewise linear approximation of the lung boundary. The set of texture features, which are the average of some local property measures, is has then extracted in this approximated lung area. The proposed technique been tested on two sets of X-ray picture classes?one with abnormalities caused by a known disease and the others with abnormalities caused by some unkown effects in the lung region. The classification results presented in this paper show the feasibility of the proposed pictorial pattern recognition system in effectively screening out the abnormal pictures without human intervention.","['Y.

This paper describes a layer structured system suitable for pattern recognition which operates similar to the afferent nervous system of vertebrates. The ``system theory of homogeneous layers'' has been developed to describe signal transmission and signal processing between neuronal layers. Feature extraction in the sense of spatial filtering is performed by such a layered system with a few hierarchical stages. The last stage contains adaptive coupling which is adjusted by a learning process. The system has been simulated with a computer and parts of it with a coherent light arrangement. Its performance im recognizing handprinted characters (alphanumerics) is highly satisfactory and corresponds approximately to the human capability for this task.,['Hans Marko'],3,['f253fef9-fcbf-4502-9b35-f4818fb91f2f'],A Biological Approach to Pattern Recognition,systems man and cybernetics,1974,e03b71e7-fb86-4164-977e-77ef7fe6c388
"This note deals with the manner in which dynamic problems, involving probabilistic constraints, may be tackled using the ideas of Lagrange multipliers and efficient solutions. Both the infinite and finite time horizon are considered. Under very general conditions, Lagrange-multiplier and efficient-solution methods will readily produce, via the dynamic-programming formulations, classes of optimal solutions. However there may be gaps in the constraint levels thus generated. It is shown that, providing we admit mixed policies, these gaps can be filled in and that, furthermore, the dynamic programming calculations may, in some general circumstances, be carried out initially in terms of pure policies, and optimal mixed policies can be generated from these. The probabilistic constraints are treated in two ways, viz., by considering situations in which constraints are placed on the probabilities with which systems enter into specific states, and by considering situations in which minimum variances of performance are required subject to constraints on mean performance. Finally the mean/variance problem is viewed from the point of view of efficient solution theory. It is seen that some of the main variance-minimization theorems may be related to this more general theory, and that efficient solutions may also be obtained using dynamic-programming methods.",['D.

"In this presentation we describe the outline of an algorithmic approach to handle a class of algebraic integrands. (It is important to stress that for an extended abstract of the present form, we can at best convey the flavor of the approach, with numerous details missing.) We shall label this approach Carlson's algorithm because it is based on a series of analyses rendered by Carlson and his associates in the last ten years (Refs. 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12). The class of integrands is of the form r(x, y), where y 2  is a polynomial in x, and r a rational function in x and y. This is the type of integrand that classically led to the study of elliptic integrals. At first glance this is a rather restricted class of algebraic functions. But in fact many trigonometric and hyperbolic integrands reduce to this form. The richness of this class of integrands is exemplified by a recently published handbook of 3000 integral formulas (Ref. 1). Our proposed approach will cover fifty to seventy percent of the items in the handbook. Furthermore the non-classical approach we shall describe holds great promise of developing to the case where definite integrals can be evaluated in terms of a host of other well-known functions (e.g., Bessel and Legendre).",['Edward W.

There is considerable literature on signals with impulse-like autocorrelation functions hut little on sets of signals with small cross correlation.

In spite of numerous difficulties in measuring certain parameters, regression analysis is used to fit income data to age and education level.

"Abstract#R##N##R##N#In designing a distributed computer network, the reliability and availability of the communication paths between all pairs of centers is a primary consideration. Many different approaches have been taken to calculate exactly the probability of successful communication between any specified pair of centers, for a given failure probability of the individual computer systems and communication facilities. However, almost all of these methods are not computationally feasible for large networks. Consequently, approximate calculations of network reliability have been suggested. In this paper a procedure is given for the exact calculation of the probability that all paths between a pair of nodes in a given network are interrupted. The procedure generates mutually exclusive sets of cutting states and calculates the probability of the related events. Summing these values one obtains the probability of service interruption between the specified pair of nodes. If all links fail with equal probability p, the coefficients of a polynomial can be calculated, describing the service disruption probability as a function of p.","['Eberhard Hänsler', 'G. K.

"The currently available microprocessors can be grouped into three classes based on functional partitioning: (1) the multichip family, consisting of compatible CPU, memory, and I/O devices; (2) the single-chip CPU, designed for standard product memory and I/O devices; and (3) the multichip microprogrammable CPU, designed for standard product memory and I/O devices. The limitations and advantages of the first two categories are well understood, since products in this class have been available for over two years and have been the subject of an avalanche of microprocessor articles. The third category, however, has been available for less than a year, and until recently has only been available as a manufacturer-defined processor system (National Semiconductor's IMP series of microprocessors). However, the manufacturer-defined processor, while providing a desirable starting point for most users, has tended to obscure some of the design flexibility of the basic chip set. The decision by National Semiconductor to provide full support for development of custom configurations of its chip set, plus the fact that designs of architecturally similar chip sets have been carried out by several other semiconductor manufacturers (including AMI, Monolithic Memories, and Raytheon) warrants a review of the unique advantages and potential pitfalls of this architecture.",['George Reyling'],50,,Considerations in choosing a microprogramable bit-sliced architecture,IEEE Computer,1974,7c1f7208-14cf-44ca-bc67-6a4667fe7120
"Recent work [AJU, E1, E2] has shown that substantial improvements in both the size and the running time of a bottom-up parser often can be realized by constructing the parser using an ambiquous underlying grammar. Various heuristic techniques are used to resolve action conflicts in the parser which result from the ambiquity of the grammar. In this paper we present a method for construction of such a parser, which includes previous methods and generalizes on them. Our method has the property that we can decide equivalence of the constructed parser to an original unambiquous grammar generating the intended language. Section I contains some terminology and a brief review of the theory of LR parsing. In Section II we define a ""n-skeletal grammar."" We then present the algorithm for construction of a ""skeletal LR (k) parser."" A skeletal LR(k) parser for G is shown to parse correctly every word in L(G), and to have the immediate error detection property of the canonical LR(k) technique. However, it shares with the precedence techniques of [GH, F] the defect that the parser may accept a proper superset of the intended language. An algorithm to decide whether a skeletal LR parser is ""valid"" for G (i.e., accepts exactly L (G)) is given in Section III. This algorithm applies to the precedence techniques as well. In Section IV we define ""local consistency"" of a skeletal LR parser, a condition which is shown to be sufficient for validity of the parser, and which can be tested with substantially less computation than is required for the general decision algorithm of Section III. Finally, the local consistency condition is applied in Section V to show two wide classes of grammars for which valid skeletal LR parsers can be constructed.",['Alan J.

"The following problem is considered: select plant sites from a given set of sites and choose their production and distribution levels to meet known demand at discrete points at minimum cost. The construction and operating cost of each plant is assumed to be a concave function of the total production at that plant, and the distribution cost between each plant and demand point is assumed to be a concave function of the amount shipped. There may be capacity restrictions on the plants. A branch-and-bound algorithm for identifying an optimal solution is described; it is equivalent to the solution of a finite sequence of transportation problems. The algorithm is developed as a particular case of a simplified algorithm for minimizing separable concave functions over linear polyhedra.

"The following are excerpts from the material that will be discussed by the panelists:   “Microprogramming and Emulation”. This experimental seminar was directed toward learning about microprogramming rather than how to microprogram because of lack of equipment. Some of the topics discussed were: Organization of Microprogrammable Machines, Languages f o r Microprogramming, Synthesis of System Architectures, Emulation and Signal Processing, and the Future of Microprogramming. Student projects from the course included an ALGOL simulation of the HP 2100 and the John Hopkins dynamic multiprocessor and a simulation package to investigate the emulation of the AN/UYK-20.—L.H. Jones   “CIS 672 - Microprogramming”. The objectives of this course are (1) teaching the basic principles of microprogramming, (2) to develop the student's ability to write microprograms and evaluate machines, (3) to demonstrate the potential of writable control store and, (4) to prepare students to do research in the microprogramming field . Material covered in the course includes: A review of control structures and history of microprogramming, development of microprograms for functions and emulators and future trends and research topics in microprogramming.—E.W. Reigel   “Microprogramming Theory” This is a graduate level course that takes up where our introductory course in microprogramming leaves off. The prerequisites are a basic understanding of microprogramming and the ability to write and debug microprograms. The course begins with discussion of control structures and micro-memory. Particular attention is placed upon microword encoding, time validity, and sequencing techniques. Micro-programming languages are developed from the standpoint of those which assume a particular hardware configuration (e.g. IBM's CAS) to those which include virtual machine definition capability (e.g. Young's ALSIM).—W.G.

"The motivation behind the work in very-high-level languages is to ease the programming task by providing the programmer with a language containing primitives or abstractions suitable to his problem area. The programmer is then able to spend his effort in the right place; he concentrates on solving his problem, and the resulting program will be more reliable as a result. Clearly, this is a worthwhile goal.   Unfortunately, it is very difficult for a designer to select in advance all the abstractions which the users of his language might need. If a language is to be used at all, it is likely to be used to solve problems which its designer did not envision, and for which the abstractions embedded in the language are not sufficient.   This paper presents an approach which allows the set of built-in abstractions to be augmented when the need for a new data abstraction is discovered. This approach to the handling of abstraction is an outgrowth of work on designing a language for structured programming. Relevant aspects of this language are described, and examples of the use and definitions of abstractions are given.","['Barbara Liskov', 'Stephen N.

"The problem of computing a desired function value to within a prescribed tolerance can be formulated in the following two distinct ways:  Formulation  I: Given x and ∈ > 0, compute  f (x) to within ∈.  Formulation  II: Given only that x is in a closed interval X, compute a subinterval of the image,  f (X) = { f (x) : x ∈ X}. The first formulation is applicable when x is known to arbitrary accuracy. The second formulation is applicable when x is known only to a limited accuracy, in which case the tolerance is prescribed albeit indirectly by the interval X, and one must be satisfied with all or part of the set  f (X) of possible function values.  Elsewhere the author has presented an efficient solution to Formulation I for any rational  f  and many nonrational  f . B. A. Chartres has presented an efficient solution to Formulation II for a very restricted class of rational  f  and for a few nonrational  f .  In this paper a solution to Formulation II for the arbitrary nonconstant rational  f  is presented.

"One important area in engineering cybernetics is that of learning systems—the analysis and synthesis of engineering systems which exhibit learning behavior. During the past decade there has been a considerable growth of research interest in problems of learning systems. Many different approaches have been proposed for the design of systems with learning capabilities. Engineering applications include pattern recognition, communication and antenna systems, and control and diagnostic problems. Recent progress has indicated that the research in learning systems has just gone through a transient period from discussions of general philosophy, concepts and formulations of the problem to studies of a possible unified theory. This progress is significant in the sense that, once a unified approach is successful, further research efforts can then be concentrated toward the depth of the theory and its applications. One of the major contributors in this direction is Prof. Tsypkin, the author of this book.

"Let F = GF(2) , and FG = F[x]/(x^n + 1). FG is the residue class ring of polynomials mod x^n + 1 . An element of FG is represented by a polynomial of degree at most n - 1 \begin{equation} c(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + \cdots + c_{n-1} x^{n-1} \end{equation} with coefficients in F . It may also be represented by a polynomial \begin{equation} g(z) = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} c(\alpha^j)z^j \end{equation} with coefficients in GF(2^m) , where m is the least integer such that n divides 2^m - 1 , and \alpha is a primitive n th root of unity.

The new theorem states that \begin{equation} zg'(z) = \frac{g(z)(g(z) + 1)}{z^n +l}. \end{equation} A typical application of this result is as follows. Let n = 2^m - 1 , where m \equiv 1 mod 2. Let \mathcal{A}_1 be the cyclic code of dimension 2m defined by the property that its check polynomial has zeros \alpha ^{-j} , where j = 1,2,\cdots , 2^{m-1} and j = l,2l,\cdots,2^{m-1} l, l = 2^i + 1 . If (i,m) = 1 this code has just three nonzero weights, namely, 2^{m-1} \pm 2^{(m-1)/2} and 2^{m-1} . The weight distribution can then be obtained from the MacWflliams identifies. These conditions are satisfied for n = 31, l = 3,5; n = 127 , l = 3,5,9; n = 511, l = 3,5,17 ; etc. Thus for n = 127, for example, the three codes \mathcal{A}_3,\mathcal{A}_5, \mathcal{A}_9 have the same weight distribution, although they are probably not equivalent in the usual sense.","['Anthony M.

"This paper considers the static flowshop-scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing, as a cost function, the mean job-completion time. Within the more general framework of combinatorial optimization problems, it defines a heuristic search technique-an approach that has been successful in the past in obtaining near-optimal solutions for problems that could not be solved exactly, either for lack of theory or because of exorbitant computational requirements. The paper presents a two-phase algorithm: The first phase searches among schedules with identical processing orders on all machines; the second refines the schedule by allowing passing. Results of computer study are presented for a large ensemble of pseudorandom problems, and for two particular problems previously cited in the literature. The method is shown to provide solutions that are exceptionally low in cost, and superior to those provided by sampling techniques in the cases for which comparison is possible. Computation time is also discussed and is given in machine-independent terms.","['Martin Jay Krone', 'Kenneth Steiglitz']",8,[],Heuristic-Programming Solution of a Flowshop-Scheduling Problem,Operations Research,1974,99c409e3-a9d5-46b1-a9c8-e733b6d5608b

The G -values optimizing each of the parameters of interest are determined, and are shown to lie in intervals that in general have nonzero widths.

"The Planner Project is constructing a Programming Apprentice to assist in knowledge based programming. We would like to provide an environment which has substantial knowledge of the semantic domain for which the programs are being written, and knowledge of the purposes that the programs are supposed to satisfy. Further, we would like to make it easy for the programmer to communicate the knowledge about the program to the Apprentice. The Apprentice is to aid in establishing and maintaining consistency of specifications, validating that modules meet their specifications, answering questions about behavioral dependencies between modules, and analyzing the implications of perturbations in modules and their specifications.#R##N##R##N#A tenet of the apprentice project is that programming is a multi-level activity: as well as writing code, programmers communicate in terms of comments and models.

The contracts and intentions discussed in this paper are an attempt to embody this kind of knowledge in a formal and yet intuitive and useful way.

"There are several instances where the classical method of triple-modular redundancy (TMR) reliability modeling may provide predictions which are inadequate. It is shown that for even simple networks such as those exhibiting fan-in and fan-out, classical methods may predict a reliability that is higher than or lower than the actual reliability. Furthermore, the classical method gives no hint as to whether the predicted number is high or low. As a solution to this problem, a method of partitioning an arbitrary network into cells such that faults in a cell are independent of faults in other cells is proposed. An algorithm is then given to calculate the reliability of any such cell, by considering only the structure of the interconnections within the cells. The value of the reliability found is exact if TMR is assumed to be a coherent system. An approximation to the algorithm is also described; this can be used to find a lower bound to the reliability without extensive calculation.","['Jacob A. Abraham', 'Daniel P.

"We study the optimal control of a shuttle system consisting of a single infinite-capacity carrier transporting passengers between two terminals. Passengers arrive according to independent Poisson processes, and at only one of the terminals can the dispatcher hold the carrier for more passengers. Our objective: to determine dispatching rules that minimize the long-run average of a linear passenger-waiting-time cost and a charge per trip made by the carrier. When complete information about the system state is available, and travel times are not random, we prove that it is best to dispatch the carrier if, and only if, the total number of passengers waiting at both terminals is greater than a cutoff value. To compute this cutoff value, we propose an iterative method and find that we can approximate it quite well by a simple function of system costs and parameters similar to the economic-lot-size formula. We propose a dispatching rule which may not be optimal for the case when only the number of passengers waiting at one terminal is known, and we compare its efficiency to that of the optimal rule that uses complete information. We outline extensions to other optimality criteria and to the case of stochastic travel times.","['Edward Ignall', 'Peter J.

"An upper bound on the error probability of a decision-feedback equalizer which takes into account the effect of error propagation is derived. The bound, which assumes independent data symbols and noise samples, is readily evaluated numerically for arbitrary tap gains and is valid for multilevel and nonequally likely data. One specific result for equally likely binary symbols is that if the worst case intersymbol interference when the first J feedback taps are Set to zero is less than the original signal voltage, then the error probability is multiplied by at most a factor of 2^J relative to the error probability in the absence of decision errors at high S/N ratios. Numerical results are given for the special case of exponentially decreasing tap gains. These results demonstrate that the decision-feedback equalizer has a lower error probability than the linear zero-forcing equalizer when there is both a high S/N ratio and a fast roll-off of the feedback tap gains.","['Donald L.

"The probability density function (pdf) for the output of an analog cross-correlator with correlated bandpass inputs is derived. The pdf is derived by a ""direct method"" without resorting to the ""characteristic function method,"" which usually requires contour integrations in a complex plane for inversion operations. The correlator consists of bandpass filters, a multiplier, and a zonal low-pass filter. We treat the general situation in which the two inputs are narrow-band signals of unequal power and of different phases. The bandpass input noises are assumed to be correlated and may have different powers. In the Appendix, another derivation for the pdf is given in the special case of equal power correlated noise. This derivation is based on the fact that the correlator output random variable is the difference of two independent noncentral chi-square variables of two degrees of freedom. We show that the two expressions for the pdf (one from the direct method and the other from the characteristic function method) are indeed equivalent. Finally, we discuss two major areas of application.","['Leonard E. Miller', 'Jhong S.

"The microprogrammed controls which have evolved following Wilkes' suggestion are for synchronous control structures. This paper presents a micro-programmable array for realizing an asynchronous control structure. The work presented here extends Jump's asynchronous control arrays to include many essential control capabilities which were lacking. The arrays realize structures which allow sequencing of operations, conditional branch, subroutine call, fork operation to create parallel processes, join of parallel processes, merging of control, and arbitration with semaphore primitives to achieve controlled access to limited resources. The control to be realized is specified as a Simple Petri net which is then translated into an array representation which represents the microprogram. The cellular array is then obtained by selecting cell configurations in accordance with the node of the array representation of the control. The circuits obtained are asynchronous and speed independent. The microprogrammed array is a cellular form of C, S, NOR, XOR synthesis of Petri Nets.",['Suhas S.

"A simple model of the storage hierarchies is formulated with the assumptions that the effect of the storage management strategy is characterized by the hit ratio fqnction. The hit ratio function and the device technology-cost function are assumed to be representable by power functions (or piece-wise power functions). The optimization of this model is a geometric programming problem. An explicit formula for the minimum hierarchy access time is derived; the capacity and technology of each storage level are determined. The opfimal number of storage levels in a hierarchy is shown to be directly proportional to the logarithm of the systems capacity with the constant of proportionality dependent upon the technolagy and hit ratio characteristics. The optimal cost ratio of adjacent storage levels is constant, as are the ratios of the device access times and storage capacities of the adjacent levels.

"A digital electronic hardware design and construction system is described. Basic to the system is a microprogrammed control processor which is used unmodified in all devices constructed using this technique. This processor has no data manipulation capabilities; all arithmetic, logic, and I/O capabilities are supplied by logically complete hardware modules called functional units. The processor supplies control signals on 256 unique instruction lines. Each of these instruction lines can be wired as a control signal to one or more functional units. A control signal may cause data transfer between functional units, test the status of a functional unit, or cause a functional unit to perform a specific internal function. A single data bus connects each of the functional units and the control processor such that the flow and manipulation of data are controlled by a microprogram. A logic machine refers to the ensemble of control processor, single data bus, several functional units, and a microprogram all arranged so that a specific digital system is constructed.","['J.Q.

"A solution is presented for the following problem: Determine a procedure that produces, for each full trio L of context-free languages (more generally, each trio of r.e. languages), a family of context-free (phrase structure) grammars which (a) defines L, (b) is simple enough for practical and theoretical purposes, and (c) in most cases is a subfamily of a well-known family of context-free (phrase structure) grammars for L if such a well-known family exists. (A full trio (trio) is defined to be a family of languages closed under homomorphism (e-free homomorphism), inverse homomorphism, and intersection with regular sets.)  The key notion in the paper is that of a grammar schema. With each grammar schema there is associated a family of interpretations. In turn, each interpretation of a grammar schema gives rise to a phrase structure grammar.

"This paper shows that there exists a class of functions called data manipulating functions (DMF's), in sequential as well as paralel processors. The circuits used to achieve these functions can be considered to form an independent functional block, called a data manipulator. A basic organization applicable to both sequential and parallel processors is then suggested. The main deviation of a parallel processor orgaization from the conventional Von Neumann organization is seen to be in the bit-slice (bis) manipulating functions. A comprehensive set of bis manipulating functions from the categories of permuting, replicating, spacing and masking is given. Implementation of the last category, the masking functions, is usually through a mask register by defining its content (mask pattern). It is found that for many operations the required mask patterns are periodic and/or monotonic. The upper bounds of generating these patterns are found. The techniques and designs of two data manipulators for the first three categories of DMF's (permuting, replicating, spacing) are given. Periodic and monotonic mask patterns are also used to help in implementing some of these functions. In addition, it is shown that the data manipulator designs presented in this paper are extremely flexible to suit the requirements of various parallel processors.",['Tse-Yun Feng'],264,"['18d13697-4140-4ecb-bfde-95a956d38a62', '1e363116-2c44-4d3d-993f-cb722583ca5f', '1f0c90d9-d6d8-4642-abd0-21a12a883fb6', '6072f459-07e4-4179-8892-6c6f1c23af5d']",Data Manipulating Functions in Parallel Processors and Their Implementations,IEEE Transactions on Computers,1974,e81ac2bc-4972-4a84-af67-c960c393b8df

"It is shown that many signal-detection problems involving binary phase and frequency modulation can be solved by considering the problem as the convolution of two independent phase distributions. When the two distributions are similar and each represents the probability density function of the phase of a sinusoid in noise, the probability of error is described in terms of modified Bessel functions by the expression obtained recently by Jain and Blachman. The probability of error can also be expressed in terms of Rice's Ie function. By appropriate definition of the signal-to-noise ratios, this general expression can be used to determine the error probability in a number of cases of practical interest, such as detection of a hard-limited phase-shift keyed (PSK) signal, PSK detection with noisy reference, DPSK detection, frequency-shift keying (FSK) detection, binary FM with discriminator detection, and binary pulse-position modulation (PPM).",['Pravin C.

"The complete instruction-by-instruction simulation of one computer system on a different system is a well-known computing technique. It is often used for software development when a hardware base is being altered. For example, if a programmer is developing software for some new special purpose (e.g., aerospace) computer X which is under construction and as yet unavailable, he will likely begin by writing a simulator for that computer on some available general-purpose machine G. The simulator will provide a detailed simulation of the special-purpose environment X, including its processor, memory, and I/O devices. Except for possible timing dependencies, programs which run on the “simulated machine X” can later run on the “real machine X” (when it is finally built and checked out) with identical effect. The programs running on X can be arbitrary — including code to exercise simulated I/O devices, move data and instructions anywhere in simulated memory, or execute any instruction of the simulated machine. The simulator provides a layer of software filtering which protects the resources of the machine G from being misused by programs on X.",['Robert P.

Local views are constructedusing certain primitives which the integration of the local views.   The diagnostics of the design tool program will partially depend on the data base handler.

"A model of a linguistic information source is proposed as a grammar that generates a language over some finite alphabet. It is pointed out that grammatical sentences generated by the source grammar contain intrinsic ""redundancy"" that can be exploited for error-corrections. Symbols occurring in the sentences are composed according to some syntactic rules determined by the source grammar, and hence are different in nature from the lexicographical source symbols assumed in information theory and algebraic coding theory. Almost all programming languages and some simple natural languages can be described by the linguistic source model proposed in this paper. In order to combat excessive errors for very noisy channels, a conventional encoding-decoding scheme that does not utilize the source structure is introduced into the communication system. Decoded strings coming out of the lexicographical decoder may not be grammatical, which indicates that some uncorrected errors still remain in the individual sentences and will be reprocessed by a syntactic decoder that converts ungrammatical strings into legal sentences of the source language by the maximum-likelihood criterion. Thus more errors in the strings coming out of the noisy channel can be corrected by the syntactic decoder using syntactic analysis than the !exicographical decoder is capable of correcting or even of detecting. To design the syntactic decoder we use parsing techniques from the study of compilers and formal languages.","['Lai-Wo Fung', 'King-Sun Fu']",8,"['08a2beca-cbec-49bd-b1ff-8092e94056ee', '17033ea5-96c3-4e51-a9ce-f663c82304a8', '1bfa8811-7ed4-4bb5-a6fd-41a35b4f9021', '49bfeb1a-86a1-4855-bf42-edacb81f5cff', 'c8520297-4dac-46a1-b252-4026e1ae7cd4', 'fa0b4274-c58c-464c-9e29-dc87e62b414f']",Maximum-likelihood syntactic decoding,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,1975,cd0a297c-3cc8-4a87-a5b4-e290568b11b5

"In digital communication systems, the error probability in the presence of intersymbol interference (II) and additive noise may be calculated to any desired degree of accuracy by well-known approximation methods which avoid the exponential computation growth (with the number of interferers) inherent in an exhaustive method, on the condition that a fast technique for computing II moments is available. Such a technique is indeed available at present, but it is strongly limited by the assumption that the data symbols are mutually independent. In this paper, this limitation is removed, and a fast procedure is given for computing H moments of correlated digital signals. The computations grow linearly with the number of interferers. The assumption made is that correlated symbols are produced by a general finite-state sequential machine. As illustrative examples, the fast procedure is applied to bipolar and Franaszek MS-43 codes.","['Gianfranco L.

If G is context free, and if one regards G as generating cycles instead of strings, the resulting language is just what one would get if he bent the strings of L(G) into cycles. This is no longer true if G is context sensitive. However, in this case too, the context-sensitive cycle languages are just the bendings of the context-sensitive string languages.

"In this paper a novel theory and algorithm for spectral factorization is presented. It is based on a criterion for minimal extraction of a so-called ""elementary factor."" Although not all positive para-hermitian matrices can be minimally factored into elementary factors, still the method can be adapted to fit the general case by increasing the degree in a well-controlled way and removing the nonminimal units of degree at the end. The method is, in this sense, strictly minimal. Moreover, the algorithm produces the spectral factor in ali cases where such a factorization does exist. Also, an independent proof of the famous spectral factorization result of Youla is obtained, so that the completeness of the method is ascertained. The procedure results in a workable and optimally minimal algorithm.","['Joos P.

"If f(x) and g(x) are the densities for the N-dimensional measurement vector x, conditioned on the classes c1 and c2, and if finite sets of samples from the two classes are available, then a decision function based on estimates f(x) and ?(x) can be used to classify future observations. In general, however, when the measurement complexity (the dimensionality N) is increased arbitrarily and the sets of training samples remain finite, a ``peaking phenomenon'' of the following kind is observed: classification accuracy improves at first, peaks at a finite value of N, called the optimum measurement complexity, and starts deteriorating thereafter. We derive, for the case of statistically independent measurements, general conditions under which it can be guaranteed that the peaking phenomenon will not occur, and the correct classification probability will keep increasing to value unity as N ? ?.

"Many communication and control systems employ signal formats that involve some form of periodic processing operation. Signals produced by samplers, scanners, multiplexors, and modulators are familiar examples. Often these signals are appropriately modeled by random processes that are cyclostationary (CS), i.e., processes with statistical parameters, such as mean and autocorrelation, that fluctuate periodically with time. In this paper we examine two methods for representing nonstationary processes that reveal the special properties possessed by CS processes. These representations are the harmonic series representation (HSR) and the translation series representation (TSR). We show that the HSR is particularly appropriate for characterizing the structural properties of CS processes and that the TSR provides natural models for many types of communication signal formats. The advantages gained by modeling signals as CS processes rather than stationary processes is illustrated by consideration of the optimum filtering problem. We present general solutions for filters that minimize mean-square error for continuous-waveform estimation, and we discuss several specific examples for the particular case of additive noise. These examples demonstrate improvement in performance over that of filter designs based on stationary models for the signal processes.","['William A. Gardner', 'L.

Building on additional results due to Zabel, we develop new planning horizon procedures and near planning horizon procedures. A brief sketch of how to develop similar results for the production smoothing problem suggests that the basic methodology developed possesses some generality. We present an extensive empirical study that reports that Wagner-Whitin planning horizons were found for a reasonably small subset of problems within 500 periods, while planning horizons, or at least near planning horizons, were found universally by the modified procedure.

"By a linguistic variable we mean a variable whose values are words or sentences in a natural or artificial language. For example, Age is a linguistic variable if its values are linguistic rather than numerical, i.e.,young, not young, very young, quite young, old, not very old and not very young, etc., rather than 20, 21,22, 23, In more specific terms, a linguistic variable is characterized by a quintuple (L>, T(L), U,G,M) in which L is the name of the variable; T(L) is the term-set of L, that is, the collection of its linguistic values; U is a universe of discourse; G is a syntactic rule which generates the terms in T(L); and M is a semantic rule which associates with each linguistic value X its meaning, M(X), where M(X) denotes a fuzzy subset of U. The meaning of a linguistic value X is characterized by a compatibility function, c: U → [0,1], which associates with each u in U its compatibility with X. Thus, the compatibility of age 27 with young might be 0.7, while that of 35 might be 0.2. The function of the semantic rule is to relate the compatibilities of the so-called primary terms in a composite linguistic value-e.g., young and old in not very young and not very old-to the compatibility of the composite value. To this end, the hedges such as very, quite, extremely, etc., as well as the connectives and and or are treated as nonlinear operators which modify the meaning of their operands in a specified fashion. The concept of a linguistic variable provides a means of approximate characterization of phenomena which are too complex or too ill-defined to be amenable to description in conventional quantitative terms. In particular, treating Truth as a linguistic variable with values such as true, very true, completely true, not very true, untrue, etc., leads to what is called fuzzy logic. By providing a basis for approximate reasoning, that is, a mode of reasoning which is not exact nor very inexact, such logic may offer a more realistic framework for human reasoning than the traditional two-valued logic. It is shown that probabilities, too, can be treated as linguistic variables with values such as likely, very likely, unlikely, etc. Computation with linguistic probabilities requires the solution of nonlinear programs and leads to results which are imprecise to the same degree as the underlying probabilities. The main applications of the linguistic approach lie in the realm of humanistic systems-especially in the fields of artificial intelligence, linguistics, human decision processes, pattern recognition, psychology, law, medical diagnosis, information retrieval, economics and related areas.",['Lotfi A.

"Recently, Bengt Hansson presented a paper about dyadic deontic logic,2 criticizing some purely axiomatic systems of dyadic deontic logic and proposing three purely semantical systems of dyadic deontic logic which he confidently called dyadic standard systems of deontic logic (DSDL1–3). Here I shall discuss the third by far most interesting system DSDL3 which is operating with preference relations. First, I shall describe this semantical system (Sections 1.1–1.3). Then I shall give an axiomatic system (Section 1.4) which is proved to be correct (Section 2) and complete (Section 3) with respect to Hansson's semantics. Finally, in face of these results Hansson's semantics will be discussed from a more intuitive standpoint. After emphasizing its intuitive attractiveness (Section 4.1) I will show that two objections often discussed in connection with preference relations do not apply to it (Section 4.2 and 4.3); more precisely, I will show that the connectedness condition for preference relations can be dropped and that, in a sense, it is not necessary to compare two possible worlds differing in infinitely many respects. (What exactly is meant by this, will become clear later on.) Yet there is a third objection to Hansson's semantics which points to a real intuitive inadequacy of DSDL3. A way of removing this inadequacy, which corresponds to Hansson's own intuitions as well as to familiar metaethical views, is suggested, but not technically realized (Section 4.4).

"Semantic decomposition results in a hierarchy of partitions which are small enough to be easily understood, and large enough to be meaningful to a program tester. Each partition results in the elimination of at least one local variable from consideration during error analysis, which further simplifies the testing process. Semantic decomposition reduces the complexity of the testing process, enhances the understandability of the program for the tester, and thus abstracts a program to a higher level. The decomposition yields a plan for hierarchical testing which, if followed conscientiously, should result in faster and more thorough testing for large or poorly structured programs. By reorganizing poorly structured programs into the modules indicated by semantic decomposition, an improved source level representation of the programs may be obtained.",['Paul M.

"Dynamic water quality modeling methodology is presented along with a number of applications of optimization theory to deterministic water quality modeling and control. Two of the applications are basically parameter estimation problems. The first involves the generation of a dynamic model for the behavior of coliform bacteria in Grand Traverse Bay, while the second is concerned with the estimation of parameters in an existing model for the growth of bacteria in organic carbon limited media. The third application utilizes the proposition that the laws of nature are in some sense optimal to aid in the characterization of an algae inhibition function. The basic problem involves the development of a model of phytoplankton succession in lakes involving two species of algae and two nutrients. An unknown algal inhibition function is treated as an unknown control that is to be determined to minimize the loss of nutrients from the system, which is considered as an approximate optimality principle for the system. The resultant solution possesses an optimal singular subarc that has an interesting ecological interpretation. An active control application utilizing the same model is also presented.","['W. F.

"This paper develops the multidimensional binary search tree (or  k -d tree, where  k  is the dimensionality of the search space) as a data structure for storage of information to be retrieved by associative searches. The  k -d tree is defined and examples are given. It is shown to be quite efficient in its storage requirements. A significant advantage of this structure is that a single data structure can handle many types of queries very efficiently. Various utility algorithms are developed; their proven average running times in an  n  record file are: insertion,  O (log  n ); deletion of the root,  O ( n  ( k -1)/ k  ); deletion of a random node,  O (log  n ); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance of searches),  O ( n  log  n ). Search algorithms are given for partial match queries with  t  keys specified [proven maximum running time of  O ( n  ( k - t )/ k  )] and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average running time of  O (log  n ).] These performances far surpass the best currently known algorithms for these tasks. An algorithm is presented to handle any general intersection query. The main focus of this paper is theoretical. It is felt, however, that  k -d trees could be quite useful in many applications, and examples of potential uses are given.",['Jon Louis Bentley'],3249,['56a41f3c-7b53-43c4-a7f9-dfdcdb51de7c'],Multidimensional binary search trees used for associative searching,Communications of The ACM,1975,e97d9c05-854e-4bd6-9301-11affc0d103f

"The quality of computer generated images of three-dimensional scenes depends on the shading technique used to paint the objects on the cathode-ray tube screen. The shading algorithm itself depends in part on the method for modeling the object, which also determines the hidden surface algorithm. The various methods of object modeling, shading, and hidden surface removal are thus strongly interconnected. Several shading techniques corresponding to different methods of object modeling and the related hidden surface algorithms are presented here.

"The analysis of tandem queues in which the output of each stage immediately becomes the input to the next is, in general, quite difficult. Although the analytic solution for the steady-state departure distribution from an M/M/N queue is well-known and that of an M/G/1 queue can be obtained if the analyst is willing to view it through a “Laplacian curtain,” the list of existing analytic solutions is not long. Some analytic “tricks” exist, but their utility is usually limited to the single-server queue. The treatment of tandem queues not fitting into these categories has been largely left to simulation. Yet this approach has its drawbacks. It is expensive and involves difficulties in designing and analyzing the simulation experiment. Approximation techniques are beginning to emerge as a wiser, faster, cheaper, and less troublesome alternative to simulation.

"Marketing managers make decisions about price, advertising, promotion, and other marketing variables on the basis of factual data, judgments, and assumptions about how the market works. BRANDAID is a flexible, on-line model for assembling these elements to describe the market and evaluate strategies. This paper motivates the model and presents its mathematics. The structure is modular so that individual decision areas can be added or deleted at will. The model is of the aggregate response type, in which decision variables relate closely to specific sales performance measures. The major submodels are advertising, promotion, price, salesmen, and retail distribution. The advertising submodel employs a long-run sales response to advertising function and a linear lag process. Promotional effects are built up from a characteristic time pattern for the type of promotion and a response curve. Salesman affect sales through a response process structurally similar to that for advertising. Retail distribution variables are intermediaries that the company affects and that in turn affect customer response. Submodel outputs combine multiplicatively.

It has long been recognized that hybrid computer systems are more cost effective than digital computers in solving many types of dynamic problems. This indeed has been the reason for the sizable number of hybrid computer systems currently in operation. The one to two order of magnitude speed advantage which hybrid computers enjoy over digital computers in solving differential equations is due to the speed of the analog subsystem. This high speed results from the high bandwidth (up to 1 megahertz) of the analog components and the parallel configuration of the analog mechanization.,"['Robert M.

"The needs of the social science user for computer-related services are not unique, but for a variety of reasons they are somewhat different from the needs of, say, the mathematician, the engineer or the physical scientist; certainly they tend to differ from those of that rare bird, the humanities user. Typically and succinctly, the social science user has a large amount of data and he doesn't know how to program. His data frequently require sorting, merging, logical and/or arithmetic manipulation and he desires as an end product frequency tabulations, cross-tabulations (each with appropriate statistics), correlations or regressions. There are other more sophisticated requests but these are the basic requirements.  In order to meet the computing requirements of these users, Princeton, like many other academic institutions, provides separate social science-oriented services. In our case, they are offered at the Computer Center by Social Science User Services. In order to simplify this discussion a bit I propose to do the following:  First, to define and explain in greater detail the needs of the social science user, indicating as I do so the ways in which those needs are met at Princeton and .

"Random processes that generate information slower than linearly with time are termed information-singular. The study of information-singularity contributes to a more thorough understanding of the mathematical nature of information generation. Specifically, it elucidates the manner in which generation of information by a time series is critically dependent on the detailed behavior of the sample functions of its spectral representation. The main theorem states that any random sequence whose spectral representation has stationary independent increments with no Brownian motion component is information-singular in the mean-squared sense. The concept of information-singularity can be construed as a means for discriminating between deterministic and nondeterministic processes. It is felt that information-singularity fulfills this discriminating function in a physically more satisfying manner than does the classical Hilbert space theory of linear and nonlinear prediction. The desire for a still more satisfying discriminant motivates investigation of the class of random processes that retain their information-singularity even when corrupted by additive noise. In the case of strictly stationary processes, the discussion focuses on the relationship between information-singularity and zero entropy. Lastly, some alternative definitions of information-singularity are considered and several open problems are identified.",['Toby Berger'],3,['db170b83-4fd5-44e0-b634-f578fe608ffb'],Information-singular random processes,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,1975,78ebfe9c-d031-46bd-9069-b12c130713fc

The nonpreemptive operation of the system is guided by an ordered list L of the tasks, according to the rule that whenever a processor becomes idle, it selects for processing the first unexecuted task on L which may validly be executed. We introduce an additional element of realism into this model by postulating the existence of a set of ""resources"" with the property that for each resource, the total usage ofthat resource at any instant oftime may not exceed its total availability. For this augmented model, we determine upper bounds on the ratio of finishing times achieved using two different lists, L and L', and exhibit constructions to show that the bounds are best possible. 2.

The ability to meet these requirements is shown to depend on the number of independent memory units and on the mapping of the data in these memories. Next, the need to align these data for processing is demonstrated and various alignment requirements are defined. Hardware which can perform this alignment function is discussed, e.g., permutation, indexing, switching or sorting networks, and a network (the omega network) based on Stone's shuffle-exchange operation [1] is presented. Construction of this network is described and many of its useful properties are proven. Finally, as an example of these ideas, an array processor is shown which allows conflict-free access and alignment of rows, columns, diagonals, backward diagonals, and square blocks in row or column major order, as well as certain other special operations.",['Duncan H.

"A formal method of correcting errors of changed, deleted, and inserted terminals in the strings of a context-free language is considered. Grammars generating strings containing these errors are first constructed from a known grammar for the language; these new grammars are then used to specify simple syntax-directed translation schemata which can parse both correct strings and strings with errors and simultaneously produce output strings in the original language. Stochastic aspects of productions and of errors are incorporated into the correction model to assign probabilities to translations produced.",['Michael G.

"In choosing the best parameters for compensation networks for systems including the human operator, the problem of nonconstant human operator parameters is encountered. In particular, some operator parameters vary in an adaptive way with plant dynamics. A satisfactory design must predict the operator's parameters for a particular system. A new technique regards the pilot as an optimal controller in one sense and the compensator as an optimal controller in another sense. The combination of man, machine, and compensator may then be represented by a dual optimization problem. To account for restricted numbers of variable parameters and unavailable states, the problem is modeled as a dual suboptimal (limited state feedback), control problem. Analytic expressions are obtained for the necessary conditions for (dual) optimality. An algorithm based on the method of successive approximations is described. This provides for rapid solution to the optimization problem. The method by which any considered design configuration can be analyzed to rapidly establish its potential with respect to 1) designers cost and 2) pilots work load is illustrated, and results are included.","['K.W.

"Terminal access to computer systems has long been and continues to be a problem of major significance. We foresee an increasing demand for access to data processing and storage facilities from interactive terminals, point-of-sales terminals, real-time monitoring terminals, hand-held personal terminals, etc. What is it that distinguishes this problem from other data communication problems? It is simply that these terminals tend to generate demands at a very low duty cycle and are basically  bursty  sources of data; in addition, these terminals are often geographically distributed. In the computer-to-computer data transmission case, one often sees high utilization of the communication channels; this is just not the case with terminal traffic. Consequently, the  cost  of providing a dedicated channel to each terminal is often prohibitive. Instead, one seeks ways to merge the traffic from many terminal sources in a way which allows them to share the capacity of one or a few channels, thereby reducing the total cost. This cost savings comes about for two reasons: first, because of the economies of scale present in the communications tariff structure; and secondly, because of the averaging effect of large populations which permit one to provide a channel whose capacity is approximately equal to the sum of the  average  demands of the population, rather than equal to the sum of the  peak  demands (i.e., the law of large numbers). This merging of traffic and sharing of capacity has been accomplished in various ways such as: polling techniques, contention systems, multiplexing, concentrating, etc. Many of these are only weak solutions to the problem of gathering low data rate traffic from sources which are geographically dispersed.","['Leonard Kleinrock', 'Fouad A.

"The diffusion of an innovation such as a new communication service is modeled using a randomly generated network of interpersonal influence between members of a social system. Each member decides to adopt the innovation when K out of his particular set of L influencers have already become adopters. A discrete-time recursion is obtained which describes the evolution in time of the fraction of adopters. The model exhibits a critical mass effect, where the number of initial adopters must exceed a critical value for the diffusion to saturate the population, otherwise the diffusion ends prematurely without substantial growth. Also exhibited is a bandwagon effect, which explains a sudden upsurge in growth following an initial period of slow diffusion. Both phenomena are amply corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations for a population of 10 000 people.","['Allen Gersho', 'Debasis Mitra']",50,[],A Simple Growth Model for the Diffusion of a New Communication Service,systems man and cybernetics,1975,a225afef-7882-458d-9aff-bd8fbcfc5d26

"In recent years adaptive linear estimation based upon the gradient-following algorithm has been proposed in a wide range of applications. However, little analysis on the convergence of the estimation has appeared when the elements of the data sequence are dependent. This paper presents such an analysis under the assumptions of stationarity and M -dependence (all data sets separated by more than a constant M  are statistically independent). It is shown that for a sufficiently small adaptation constant, the mean error in the estimator weights converges to a finite limit, generally nonzero. In addition, hounds on the norm of the mean weight-deviation and on the mean norm-square of the weight-deviation are found and shown to converge to asymptotic bounds, which can be made arbitrarily small by decreasing the adaptation constant and increasing the data block length over which gradient estimates are made.","['Jae-Kyoon Kim', 'Lee D.

"Most current attempts at automatic speech recognition are formulated in an artificial intelligence framework. In this paper we approach the problem from an information-theoretic point of view. We describe the overall structure of a linguistic statistical decoder (LSD) for the recognition of continuous speech. The input to the decoder is a string of phonetic symbols estimated by an acoustic processor (AP). For each phonetic string, the decoder finds the most likely input sentence. The decoder consists of four major subparts: 1) a statistical model of the language being recognized; 2) a phonemic dictionary and statistical phonological rules characterizing the speaker; 3) a phonetic matching algorithm that computes the similarity between phonetic strings, using the performance characteristics of the AP; 4) a word level search control.

This paper discusses two approaches to VLDB management: centralized control, where a powerful DB administrator makes all the important decisions about the contents, representation, and access authorization; and distributed control, where the authority to make those decisions is shared between an administration oriented central office and many action oriented users. It is claimed that in large complex enterprises, whether private or public, the organizational and social aspects of DB usage outweigh the technological ones. Arguments are presented to support the thesis that, in such environments, only a regime of distributed control can meet the users' needs and provide the required adaptability, perspicuity and responsiveness.

However, degeneracy makes it difficult to find a sequence of pivots leading to an integer optimum. In this paper we give a constructive characterization of adjacency relations between integer vertices of the feasible set that enables us to generate edges (all, if necessary) connecting a given integer vertex to adjacent integer vertices.

"Recently developed methods of tree source coding with a fidelity criterion are applied to speech coding. We first demonstrate that tree codes are inherent in A-D speech convertors of the waveform following type and point to ordinary and adaptive delta modulation and differential pulse code modulation (DPCM) as examples. Insights of coding theory improve these trees at low rates; we offer two new code classes, one obtained by smoothing the DPCM tree and one using the rate-distortion theory of autoregressive sources. Using these codes, we study the performance of a simple synchronous tree searching algorithm called the M -algorithm that maintains a small fixed number of paths in contention. 1 and 2 bit/sample code trees, used to encode actual speech at 8, 10, and 16 kbits/s, yield improved dynamic range and channel error resistance, and 4-8 dB improvement in mean-square error (mse) over ordinary single-path searched DPCM. These improvements in excess of analytical estimates suggest that tree coding methods perform better with real-life sources than previously thought.","['John B. Anderson', 'John B.

Then on-going steps take over with firefighting, tracking and diagnosis, updating and evolution, and re-use. Calibration of the model is approached eclectically in stages that include judgment, analysis of historical data, tracking, field measurement, and adaptive control. A three-year case study shows that unexpected events intersperse a planned implementation. The model emerges with multiple roles in the marketing management process. The model serves not only as a means of evaluating strategies in annual planning and day-to-day operations but also as part of a monitoring system that compares model predictions with actual sales to uncover marketing problems and focus managerial attention upon them.",['John D.

"There is presently no natural, convenient way to represent synchronization between communicating processes. Two dimensional graph models seem to offer the most natural representations, and of these the Petri net is perhaps the most basic. The author has been working on graph models similar to Petri nets, stressing the ease and convenience of the model as a descriptive device rather than attempting to prove properties such as liveness and safeness. It is shown that Petri nets are incapable of representing some simple and interesting synchronization problems such as reader-writer problems.

"Although motion is one of the most fundamental aspects of the visual world, its use has not been widely explored in the field of scene description. This correspondence describes a program that demonstrates the feasibility of segmenting a scene into regions on the basis of velocity. A velocity measure is obtained by determining the amount of displacement of a reference feature between two pictures of the same scene. The pictures are taken only a short time apart so that the reference features can be correlated between the pictures on the basis of spatial position alone. This velocity measurement is associated with absolute reference points superimposed over the scene. It is assumed that all parts of an object have the same velocity measurement. Thus the velocity measurements associated with the reference points provide a means of classifying them as ``belonging'' to the same object. Points ``inside'' moving objects fall into either of two velocity measurement classes, which are easily correlated. Since the velocity of an object is independent of its color, a scene is segmented into regions that contain complete objects even if the objects are not monochromatic.",['Jerry L.

"Most graphics languages are composed of a primitive set of commands which allow for the creation and manipulation of graphical objects. These commands are generally at a low level, in that each command causes one operation to be performed. Often the commands are to subroutines embedded in an algorithmic language so that the arithmetic and control features of the higher level language may be used.ESP 3  (Extended SNOBOL Picture Pattern Processor) is a new high-level graphics and pattern recognition language. ESP 3  was designed in an effort to provide simple, natural, and efficient manipulation of line drawings. ESP 3  differs from present graphics languages in the following ways:1) It provides a high-level method for picture construction. The evaluation of a picture expression (analagous to the SNOBOL4 string-valued expression) causes the construction of a picture.2) It provides extensive referencing facilities for naming and accessing points, subpictures, and attributes of pictures.3) It provides predicates for testing attributes of and relationships among pictures and points.4) It provides a means for defining picture patterns that describe classes of line drawings in much the same way that SNOBOL4 patterns describe classes of strings. Picture pattern matching is a built-in facility.ESP 3  is based on the premise that structural descriptions are an essential part of both picture construction and pattern recognition. The concept of a structural description of a picture has its origin with the linguistic-approach to pattern recognition. In the linguistic approach, formal grammars are used as a mechanism for picture description. [Kirsch (1964), Narasimhan (1964, 1966,1970), Anderson (1968), Evans (1968), Miller and Shaw (1969), Fu and Swain (1971), Shaw (1970, 1972), Chien and Ribak (1972), Thomason and Gonzalez (1975)]. Stanton (1970) described a graphics language based on linguistic pattern recognition. ESP 3  incorporates and extends many ideas from the above work, and includes all of the features of SNOBOL4 to provide a high-level graphics and pattern recognition language. Some suggested applications of ESP 3  are the generation of graphical output, AI programs with imaging capabilities, pattern recognition systems, and scene analysis programs.This paper will describe picture construction and pattern recognition in ESP with emphasis on picture construction. Some tests performed with an experimental version of ESP 3  will also be discussed. For a more detailed description of ESP 3 , see Shapiro (1974).",['Linda G.

The algorithms are designed to work well in systems which use multiple levels of storage, and large virtual address space.

"This correspondence is a modification of the basic SHR-optimal 1  state assignment procedure for the D flip-flop. Under the minimum sum-of-products (MSOP) constraint, a sequential machine with n D flip-flops has 2 n  times as many distinct state assignments and twice as many distinct state assignment columns as the other flip-flop types. This correspondence shows that even though the D flip-flop machine has 2 n N total distinct state assignments, the costs of these assignments can be uniquely determined by examination of only N of these assignments. Integration of this concept into the basic SHR-optimal algorithm produces a computational saving on the order of 2 n-1  times.","['P. Noe', 'V. T.

"When parallel processes are linked in producer-consumer pairs and share a finite buffer where every portion is accessible to each process, it appears that a slow consumer may considerably delay the entire system.Using conditional critical sections, Dijkstra has proposed to reserve for each producer-consumer pair the adequate number of portions for a normal working and to dedicate the rest of the buffer to absorb the production peaks of the various pairs.

Cooprider et al. then developed solutions which avoid systematic inspection and only use the now classical synchronisation primitives P and V.The present paper is devoted to the elaboration of solutions which improve parallelism and, when useful, discharge processes of administrative tasks.We have used and compared four synchronising methods to this aim: conditional critical sections, semaphores, path expressions and monitors.","['Raymond Devillers', 'Guy Louchard']",5,,Improvement of parallelism in a finite buffer sharing policy,The Computer Journal,1976,bd4eeac2-e77e-4885-96a0-9ef921ff8cad

"A general fixed structure automaton acting in stationary random multireaction environment is described. Some necessary conditions are shown for automata to be purposeful or adaptive in an unknown environment (to be more profitable than a no-purpose, or random, automaton). By the necessary conditions it is proved that there exists no perfectly adaptive automaton. A necessary condition for automata with minimum state space to be purposeful is obtained. This condition characterizes their structures explicitly, so that a little restriction gives a sufficient condition. Some general subclasses of automata are proposed, and necessary and sufficient conditions for such automata to be purposeful are investigated. Furthermore as properties of a purposeful automaton, the time required to adapt and the stability of adapting to the random environment are discussed.","['Hirotomo Aso', 'Masayuki Kimura']",2,"['26cf5687-174c-4f5e-86aa-8024247ba9ff', '46b5272a-e5ac-404f-b075-573004497ae0', '6175f298-84df-412f-af1b-2f74d7abb183', 'd992e482-b38d-40a5-9f0c-118fc93e9a17', 'e9d25b83-ee03-454c-887c-7e3cf095aeb6', 'f4363267-e876-4ef9-85f2-032442ef5a00']",The Structures of Automata to Adapt to an Unknown Environment,systems man and cybernetics,1976,9963503b-6274-44f2-93c9-bcbcf7299878

The cash flow system is modelled in a fashion similar to the modelling of control systems. Certain parts of it are modelled as discrete-time systems.

"Various techniques are described to measure, small displacements of television images. If two successive video frames are considered, their differences are approximately a linear combination of the components of the displacement of the object. If all the points of the frame undergo the same movement, then the velocity estimation problem is solved using linear estimation. However, if some points belong to the moving object and the others to the background, the problem can be stated in the same way only if an algorithm is available to segment the image into fixed and moving areas. Afterwards, linear estimation can be applied to the moving area only. In this paper a segmentation algorithm is proposed which uses dynamic programming (Viterbi algorithm with three states). A more complex situation arises when the points belonging to the moving area are subjected to different movements. The problem can be solved once more using dynamic programming if the displacement components are quantized into (2M + 1) (2M + 1) values, and the number of states of the Viterbi algorithm is augmented to (2M + 1)^{2} . To reduce the technical difficulties of this approach, a simpler method that makes possible the estimation of the n most probable displacements is proposed. Then the image is segmented into n moving areas with different displacements and a background area using a Viterbi algorithm with n + 1 states. Experimental results show that the precision obtainable is about 0.1 pel when the displacements are up to 2-3 pels, the object had approximate dimensions of 90 \times 90 pels, and the signal-to-noise ratio was higher than 33 dB.","['C.

"Historically, the existence of compiler-compilers is a result of using syntax-directed compiling techniques in order to structure the compiler. Syntax becomes a language in which parts of the compiler may be written, and the concept is extended to semantics by including a compatible programming language, usually general purpose, which allows classical programming methods for those parts of the compiler not susceptible to treatment by syntax. We will divide the subject in two parts, dealing first with those compiler-compilers whose formal treatment is limi­ ted to context-free grammars, and subsequently with extensions of these formalisms by one method or another. This division is strictly arbitrary, but corresponds to a practical fact, which is that the former class can be used, and indeed are being used, in a commercial environment to produce efficient compilers more easily than by ad hoc methods.

"The paper presents models for discrete-time point processes (DTPP) and schemes for recursive estimation of signals randomly influencing their rates. Although the models are similar to the better known models of signals in additive Gaussian noise, DTPP differ from these in that it is possible for DTPP's to find recursive representations for the nonlinear filters. If the signal can be modeled as a finite state Markov process, then these representations reduce to explicit recursive finite-dimensional filters. The derivation of the estimation schemes, as well as the filters themselves, present a surprising similarity to the Kalman filters for signals in Gaussian noise.

"The problems of file allocation and capacity assignment in a fixed topology distributed computer network are examined. These two aspects of the design are tightly coupled by means of an average message delay constraint. The objective is to allocate copies of information files to network nodes and capacities to network links so that a minimum cost is achieved subject to network delay and file availability constraints. A model for solving the problem is formulated and the resulting optimization problem is shown to fall into a class of nonlinear integer programming problems. Deterministic techniques for solving this class of problems are computationally cumbersome, even for small size problems. A new heuristic algorithm is developed, which is based on a decomposition technique that greatly reduces the computational complexity of the problem. Numerical results for a variety of network configurations indicate that the heuristic algorithm, while not theoretically convergent, yields practicable low cost solutions with substantial savings in computer processing time and storage requirements. Moreover, it is shown that this algorithm is capable of solving realistic network problems whose solutions using deterministic techniques are computationally intractable.","['Samy A. Mahmoud', 'J. S.

This note is concerned with some essential characteristics of the feasible solutions for a job-shop scheduling problem in which the jobs are constrained by fixed starting times and due dates. These characteristics are related to the scheduling order of operations on each machine and to the fixed starting and completion times for each operation.

"Strategy for processing multivariable queries in the database management system INGRES is considered. The general procedure is to decompose the query into a sequence of one-variable queries by alternating between (a) reduction: breaking off components of the query which are joined to it by a single variable, and (b) tuple substitution: substituting for one of the variables a tuple at a time. Algorithms for reduction and for choosing the variable to be substituted are given. In most cases the latter decision depends on estimation of costs; heuristic procedures for making such estimates are outlined.","['Eugene Wong', 'Karel Youssefi']",485,"['369b06cd-da29-4822-95b8-96151b0ba62e', '620d450e-33f2-4711-b6e0-714eb4f8dae4', '6eada164-8b88-4ee8-bc63-854b8e4eae14', '7e219fae-4077-40ed-aaad-218c9eb93009']",Decomposition—a strategy for query processing,ACM Transactions on Database Systems,1976,f504d50a-1143-414a-a378-0b249588608a

"The concept of abstract data types has emerged from programming language research as a device to encourage and facilitate structured and modular programming [1]. It separates the abstraction of a data object from its implementation. The user of an abstract data type only concerns himself with the behavioral semantics of the type: what meaningful operations can be applied to objects of the type; the internal representation and structure of the type is unknown to him. In this way, irrelevent detail is suppressed and meaningfulness of programs enhanced.   What application does this concept have to the area of data bases? There are some obvious similarities between the principle of abstraction and the concept of data independence of data bases [2]. Data independence means that application programs that utilize a data base do not need to know either the physical or the structural organization of the data base, but can relate to it purely on a logical plane. As with data abstractions, the goal is clarity and modifiability of programs, resulting from concentration on semantics rather than representation.",['Michael Hammer'],50,"['aca42652-1bea-4f55-8b4b-517988132814', 'bb7f04fd-6e9d-497a-8e41-dce67b7a54e9', 'c9daf25c-1900-4b85-be48-b81755c6486f', 'e930195e-baa4-4d42-9d5f-e042fcaf5a9e']",Data abstractions for data bases,international conference on management of data,1976,b382eb37-1e01-4c21-ade3-a828db796d18

We prove, using directly a fixed point theorem, with an appropriate condition on f, that the above problem has a solution.

If this subset is empty, the algorithm is a standard one [And 1, Kn]. If this subset consists of all chain productions, the result is a parser with all chain reductions optimized away. The algorithm, as in [Pag5], also eliminates from the parsers all nonterminals which occur as the left part of useless chain productions. This latter optimization along with the chain reduction optimization significantly decreases the storage space and execution times of the parsers.

Derivations show that the piece-wise continuous functions resulting from polynomial interpolation have unbiased expected values and biased variances.

A new two level method is developed for the optimization of non-linear dynamical systems with a quadratic cost function. This method used an expansion around the equilibrium point of the system to fix the second and higher order terms. These terms are compensated for iteratively at the second level by providing a prediction for the states and controls which form a part of the higher order terms. A proof of the convergence of the algorithm is provided. The algorithm is tested on a problem of synchronous machine excitation where fast convergence is obtained. A comparison is also made with the global solution of the problems using quasi-linearisation. It is seen that the new method takes less than half the computation time of the global solution.,"['Mohamed F. Hassan', 'Madan G.

"The representation of a collection of data in terms of its differences from some preestablished point of reference is a basic storage compaction technique which finds wide applicability. This paper describes a differential database representation which is shown to be an efficient method for storing large and volatile databases. The technique confines database modifications to a relatively small area of physical storage and as a result offers two significant operational advantages. First, because the “reference point” for the database is inherently static, it can be simply and efficiently stored. Second, since all modifications to the database are physically localized, the process of backup and the process of recovery are relatively fast and inexpensive.","['Dennis G. Severance', 'Guy M.

"A parallel algorithm is presented which speeds up the operation of arbitrary infinite impulse response (IIR) digital filters by an integer factor n. When n is a power of two or highly composite a special numerator factorization significantly reduces the number of multipliers required for large n. The resulting filter can operate at a sampling rate exceeding the inverse of a multiply time. Hence, such filters are not multiplier speed limited. The IIR algorithm is shown to share the desirable property of the FIR algorithm that when resampling is done at the output, part of the filter hardware can be eliminated. The IIR parallel algorithm implements a degenerate filter form. The implications of this on practical filter design are considered and a design example given. It is shown that implementations of these parallel filters can exhibit reduced sensitivity allowing a reduction in the multiplier constant length.",['Alan L.

"This paper presents a design procedure for single-loop feedback systems in which the plant is nonminimum-phase, with ignorance in its parameters. The feedback system is to be designed such that the time response to a deterministic input lies within specified boundaries. Subject to the above, the design should be such as to minimize the effect of sensor noise at the input to the plant. The time domain tolerances are translated into equivalent frequency response tolerances. The latter lead to bounds on the loop-transmission L(jw), in the form of continuous curves on the Nichols chart. However due to the nonminimum-phase nature of the plant, it may happen that no L(jw) can be found so that the design specifications of the problem are achieved, unless they are changed accordingly.",['Marcel Sidi'],3,[],"Brief paper: Feedback synthesis with plant ignorance, nonminimum-phase, and time-domain tolerances",Automatica,1976,fe6fd2b9-f2ce-4a5c-94a3-9b23b200fc2a

"This paper presents a program interpreting orthographic drawings input through a digitizing tablet into three-dimensional (3-D) objects. Ambiguity arises in such a task not only in the case of two views but also with three-view inputs, due to coinciding projections of vertices. The main effort consists in heuristically reducing this ambiguity. The general strategy is a bottom-up identification of the objects starting with the tablet-coordinates and aggregating them into vertices, then faces and finally polyhedra. The program does not contain any high level geometrical concepts or probable properties of 3-D objects but only some basic definitions of polyhedra (as expressed by Euler and Mobius). By applying these definitions to different parts of the scene to recognize, it defines local sets of alternatives and then chooses the right ones by running a mini theorem prover over these sets. A major issue in writing this program has been to limit the drawing constraints imposed on the user.

In the analysis of the machine-model parallel rewriting appears to be a fundamental tool for breaking the implicit recursion-structure. Variations of the machine-model (in the sense of Cook) lead to a natural hierarchy of machines defining DLOG, NLOG, P, NP, and PSPACE, showing different ways in which one class may be considered a restriction of another (as anticipated also in Galil's work on hierarchies of complete problems).

"An excursion is made into the history and prehistory of computers with special attention to Central Europe. Three historic periods are examined. The period of programmed automata is rich in the development of programmed clocks and musical instruments beginning in the 14th century and continuing through the 18th century. The period of programmed weaving to punched cards ranges from the Jacquard loom to the Hollerith card. It can be noted that the Jacquard card and the Hollerith card are the same width. Predecessors of Jacquard can be found in Austria as early as 1680 or 1690. The Hollerith card was used in census of 1890 in Austria, a fact not as well known as its use in the United States census of 1890. The story of Otto Schaeffler, the engineer who produced the equipment for the Austrian census, is a fascinating one. The third period is the period of programmed calculation. The computer is the product of two streams of development, calculating devices and programmed calculation, and contributions from Central Europe are prominent in both streams. Among the names which must be included are those of Petzval, Boltzman, Goedel, Morgenstern and Von Neumann. Attention is called to two contributions from the author's laboratories, namely, the 1954 fully transistorized computer, ""Mailufterl,"" and the ""Vienna Definition Language.""",['Heinz Zemanek'],50,,Computer prehistory and history in central Europe,,1976,5a75e27b-8301-4d7e-afcf-4641cd75f02b

PBS has a data definition facility that enables one to specify structures needed for a given application, a manipulation facility for loading and editing the data, and displaying the image stored in the structures. The structures are defined in a relational data base and allow graphical attributes to be specified in the same way as nongraphical attributes. There is a deliberate attempt to separate data from programs which is in accord with other data-base developments. It is also possible to mix text and vector data with raster scan data which we have found to be very useful in some graphical applications.

"The ideas described in this paper arise from a particular investigation of the general question: when information relevant to a sequence of decisions is collected by statistical sampling, is it worth controlling the local rate of sampling to provide more accurate information at certain times? Here, the value of any sampling and decision procedure is measured by the long-term average of all information and decision costs. The model is concerned with the design of a control chart and it leads to a Markovian decision problem with three possible actions at each point of the state space. The determination of an optimal policy depends on the solution of a complicated free boundary problem. Although there is a well-established relation between the basic partial differential equation of this problem and Brownian motion, the investigation raises many questions, both analytical and probabilistic, which remain to be answered. However, some limited results are obtained by examining special formal solutions. In spite of serious gaps in the general theory, it is possible to establish useful bounds on the minimum average cost which can be attained.",['J. A.

"This paper develops a mathematical theory for solving deterministic, Lanchester-type, 'square-law' attrition equations for combat between two homogeneous forces with temporal variations in fire effectivenesses (as expressed by the Lanchester attrition-rate coefficients). It gives a general form for expressing the solution of such variablecoefficient combat attrition equations in terms of Lanchester functions, which are introduced here and can be readily tabulated. Different Lanchester functions arise from different mathematical forms for the attrition-rate coefficients. We give results for two such forms: (1) effectiveness of each side's fire proportional to a power of time, and (2) effectiveness of each side's fire linear with time but with a nonconstant ratio of attrition-rate coefficients. Previous results in the literature for a nonconstant ratio of these attrition-rate coefficients only took a convenient form under rather restrictive conditions.","['James G. Taylor', 'Gerald G.

"The ways that the methods of data flow analysis can be applied to improve software reliability are described. There is also a review of the basic terminology from graph theory and from data flow analysis in global program optimization. The notation of regular expressions is used to describe actions on data for sets of paths. These expressions provide the basis of a classification scheme for data flow which represents patterns of data flow along paths within subprograms and along paths which cross subprogram boundaries. Fast algorithms, originally introduced for global optimization, are described and it is shown how they can be used to implement the classification scheme. It is then shown how these same algorithms can also be used to detect the presence of data flow anomalies which are symptomatic of programming errors. Finally, some characteristics of and experience with DAVE, a data flow analysis system embodying some of these ideas, are described.","['Lloyd D. Fosdick', 'Leon J.

"The probability density and confidence intervals for the maximum entropy (or regression) method (MEM) of spectral estimation are derived using a Wishart model for the estimated covariance. It is found that the density for the estimated transfer function of the regression filter may be interpreted as a generalization of the student's t distribution. Asymptotic expressions are derived which are the same as those of Akaike. These expressions allow a direct comparison between the performance of the maximum entropy (regression) and maximum likelihood methods under these asymptotic conditions. Confidence intervals are calculated for an example consisting of several closely space tones in a background of white noise. These intervals are compared with those for the maximum likelihood method (MLM). It is demonstrated that, although the MEM has higher peak to background ratios than the MLM, the confidence intervals are correspondingly larger.

"Let \{(X_{k}, Y_{k}) \}^{ \infty}_{k=1} be a sequence of independent drawings of a pair of dependent random variables X, Y . Let us say that X takes values in the finite set \cal X . It is desired to encode the sequence \{X_{k}\} in blocks of length n into a binary stream of rate R , which can in turn be decoded as a sequence \{ \hat{X}_{k} \} , where \hat{X}_{k} \in \hat{ \cal X} , the reproduction alphabet. The average distortion level is (1/n) \sum^{n}_{k=1} E[D(X_{k},\hat{X}_{k})] , where D(x,\hat{x}) \geq 0, x \in {\cal X}, \hat{x} \in \hat{ \cal X} , is a preassigned distortion measure. The special assumption made here is that the decoder has access to the side information \{Y_{k}\} . In this paper we determine the quantity R \ast (d) , defined as the infimum ofrates R such that (with \varepsilon > 0 arbitrarily small and with suitably large n )communication is possible in the above setting at an average distortion level (as defined above) not exceeding d + \varepsilon . The main result is that R \ast (d) = \inf [I(X;Z) - I(Y;Z)] , where the infimum is with respect to all auxiliary random variables Z (which take values in a finite set \cal Z ) that satisfy: i) Y,Z conditionally independent given X ; ii) there exists a function f: {\cal Y} \times {\cal Z} \rightarrow \hat{ \cal X} , such that E[D(X,f(Y,Z))] \leq d . Let R_{X | Y}(d) be the rate-distortion function which results when the encoder as well as the decoder has access to the side information \{ Y_{k} \} . In nearly all cases it is shown that when d > 0 then R \ast(d) > R_{X|Y} (d) , so that knowledge of the side information at the encoder permits transmission of the \{X_{k}\} at a given distortion level using a smaller transmission rate. This is in contrast to the situation treated by Slepian and Wolf [5] where, for arbitrarily accurate reproduction of \{X_{k}\} , i.e., d = \varepsilon for any \varepsilon >0 , knowledge of the side information at the encoder does not allow a reduction of the transmission rate.","['Aaron D.

"A computer program, the Line Drawing Editor (LDE), that allows convenient modification of computer representations of simple line drawings has been designed and implemented. The distinguishing feature of the LDE from the multitude of interactive graphics programs that accomplish the same function is the use of a computer controlled TV camera for input and program control rather than conventional interactive input devices such as light pens or data tablets. A graphical editing language allows the LDE user to indicate, by marking the drawing in appropriate fashion, the changes that are to be made. The drawing, which was generated on a hardcopy output device, with the added edit information is placed in front of the camera. In successive phases the LDE computes a two dimensional homogeneous transformation relating the viewed drawing and its computer description, locates the lines added to the drawing, parses the added lines according to the edit language and finally uses this information to update the drawing description.",['John F.

"The Permuterm Subject Index (PSI) section of the Science Citation Index (SCI) was designed more than ten years ago and has been published both quarterly and annually since 1966. There is, however, no ‘primordial’ citable paper about the PSI. It has been described and discussed from different standpoints in a number of papers (1,2), but none of them provides the formal description usually accorded a new bibliographic tool. This article is intended to provide such a reference point for future workers in information science. The PSI was designed in 1964 at the Institute for Scientific Information (1S1) by myself and Irving Sher, my principal research collaborator at the time. In the subsequent development of the PSI, contributions were also made by others, including Arthur W. Elias, who was then in charge of production operations at 1S1. In the early sixties we were too preoccupied with the task of convincing the library and information community of the value of citation indexing even to consider the idea of publishing a word index. But it was a logical development once we added the Source Zndex containing full titles. The value of the PSI as a ‘natural language’ index is now well recognized and exploited by its users, but this was not the original reason for its development. The PSI was developed as one solution to a problem commonly faced by uses of the Citation index section of the Science Citation Index (SCZ_). While the typical scientist-user could enter the Citation Index with a known author or paper, other users with a limited knowledge of the subject often lacked a starting point for their search. Before publication of the PSI, we told users whose unfamiliarity with subject matter left them doubtful about a starting point to consult an encyclopedia or the subject index of a book. If these failed, we told them to use another index, such as Chemical Abstracts, Biological Abstracts, Physics Abstracts or Index Medicus. Once the user identified a relevant older paper, it could be used to begin a search in the Citation Index. Users of the SC1—and librarians in particular needed some tool with which a starting point, or what used to be called a target reference, could be quickly and easily identified. In those days the information community was pre-occupied with KeyWord-in-Context (KWIC] indexes. The development of the KWIC index, which was subsequently vigorously marketed by IBM, undoubtedly had an enormous impact (3, 4, 5). But I was never happy with the KWIC system for a number of reasons. First, Sher and I felt that the KWIC index was highly uneconomical for a printed index. KWIC’S use of space is prodigious, and it can be extremely time-consuming to use in searches involving more than one term. 546",['Eugene Garfield'],50,[],The Permuterm Subject Index: An Autobiographical Review.,Journal of The American Society for Information Science,1976,8b286364-c95b-487e-8d57-bb718dd96c43
"The methodology of discrete time, extended Kalman filtering is applied to the problem of identifying parameters of a macroscopic freeway traffic model. Macroscopic models provide a representation of traffic flow in terms of its gross properties, i.e., volume, density, and speed. The local identifiability of a parameterization of macroscopic model at nominal values of the unknown parameters is checked before any identification is attempted. It is shown that the parameterization is locally identifiable. Two parameters of the model (reaction time and sensitivity to changing density) were identified through the use of this methodology. The data base for studies to date was generated from a microscopic simulation of freeway traffic, which involves following all individual vehicle movements. Techniques for extending the methodology to employ real freeway traffic data, especially as can be obtained from automated surveillance systems, are discussed.","['Mohinder S. Grewal', 'Harold J.

"Query-by-Example is a high level non-procedural data base language which provides the end user with a simplified unified interface for  querying, updating, defining , and  maintaining , the data base, as well as imbedding various  integrity  and  authority  constraints. When querying the data base the user fills in, through a keyboard display, an example of a possible answer in a skeleton of the logical structure of the data base. As demonstrated in previous work, when the data base is relational, skeleton tables are used. In this paper, we show that the Query-by-Example operations are in fact independent of the structure of the data base. In particular, we demonstrate that if the view at the user interface level is hierarchical, the query is again accomplished by filling-in an example of a possible answer, but, in this case, a skeleton of the hierarchy is utilized. It is, also, shown how the user can map a relational view into a hierarchical view and vice versa, formulating queries that involve both views simultaneously.

"This paper presents a new data structure, called a compressed trie or C-trie, to be used in information retrieval systems. It has the same underlying m-ary tree structure as a trie, where m is a parameter of the trie, but whereas the fields of the nodes in a trie have to be large enough to hold a key or at least a pointer, the fields in a C-trie are only one bit long. In the analysis part of the paper it will be shown that for a collection of n keys the retrieval time, measured in terms of bit inspections of one key, is of the order log m n and the storage requirement of the order n·(m + log 2 n) bits. This improvement in storage requirements and retrieval time is achieved at the cost of decreasing the flexibility of the structure, and therefore updating costs are increased. First the C-trie is analyzed as a data structure, and then several methods of its use for relatively static databases are discussed.",['Kurt Maly'],82,[],Compressed tries,Communications of The ACM,1976,a75fb4fb-4d6c-4561-ae76-6986ebc33bfd
"We consider an important class of mathematical programs, in which the vector variable can be partitioned into two subvectors corresponding to independent constraint sets. Necessary and sufficient conditions for optimal solutions are developed, and two approaches for obtaining solutions are reviewed. We present an enumeration approach, reducing the problem to a finite number of subproblems, and show that duality makes the solution of many of the subproblems unnecessary. Next, we develop an alternating approach, wherein the problem is solved for one of the subvectors while the other is held constant, and then the subvector roles are reversed. This procedure is observed to converge to partial optimum solutions. A widely applicable subclass of problems includes a linear program in one of the subvectors. For this subclass a sufficient condition for local optimality is determined. The condition is easily testable and fails to hold, in many cases, only if a better solution is obtained. Also, this condition shows that partial optimum solutions are almost always local optima.","['Richard E. Wendell', 'Arthur P.

"The problem of estimating a member of a scalar random signal sequence with quantum-mechanical measurements is considered. The minimum variance linear estimator based on an optimal present quantum measurement and optimal linear processing of past measurements is found. When the average optimal measurement without postprocessing, for a fixed signal, is linear in the random signal and the signal sequence is pairwise Gaussian, the optimal processing separates: the optimal measurement is the same as the optimal measurement without regard to past data, and the past and present data are processed classically. The results are illustrated by considering the estimator of the real amplitude of a laser signal received in a single-mode cavity along with thermal noise; when the random signal sequence satisfies a linear recursion, the estimate can be computed recursively. For a one-step memory signal sequence it is shown that the optimal observable generally differs from the optimal observable disregarding the past; the optimal measurement can be computed recursively.","['John S.

"A space-time point process is a stochastic process having as realizations points with random coordinates in both space and time. We define a general class of space-time point processes which we term {\em analytic}. These are point processes that have only finite numbers of points in finite time intervals, absolutely continuous joint-occurrence distributions, and for which points do not occur with certainty in finite time intervals. Analytic point processes possess an intensity determined by the past of the point process. As a class, analytic point processes remain closed under randomization by a parameter. The problem we consider is that of estimating a random parameter of an observed space-time point process. This parameter may be drawn from a function space and can, therefore, model a random variable, random process, or random field that influences the space-time point process. Feedback interactions between the point process and the randomizing parameter are included. The conditional probability measure of the parameter given the observed space-time point process is a sufficient statistic for forming estimates satisfying a wide variety of performance criteria.

"The representation of integers by their residues with respect to a set of pairwise-prime moduli is known as the residue number representation system and has been shown to have several advantages over conventional number systems for digital computers. In this paper, residue systems are considered for which each modulus is of the form 2 b -1. Such systems result in relatively high storage efficiency as well as simple algorithms for addition, subtraction multiplication, conversion, and reconversion; hence the name ""low-cost."" The question of existence for low-cost residue number systems is examined. It is shown that the additional storage requirement with respect to binary representation is at most one bit per word. Guidelines are given for optimal selection of the set of moduli to represent a desired range of integers.

"Sliding-block codes are nonblock coding structures consisting of discrete-time time-invariant possibly nonlinear filters. They are equivalent to time-invariant trellis codes. The coupling of Forney's rigorization of Shannon's random-coding/typical-sequence approach to block coding theorems with the strong Rohlin-Kakutani Theorem of ergodic theory is used to obtain a sliding-block coding theorem for ergodic sources and discrete memoryless noisy channels. Combining this result with a theorem on sliding-block source coding with a fidelity criterion yields a sliding-block information transmission theorem. Thus, the basic existence theorems of information theory hold for stationary nonblock structures, as well as for block codes.","['Robert M. Gray', 'Donald S.

"Reorganization is necessary in some databases for overcoming the performance deterioration caused by updates. The paper presents a dynamic reorganization algorithm which makes the reorganization decision by measuring the database search costs. Previously, the reorganization intervals could only be determined for linear deterioration and known database lifetime. It is shown that the dynamic reorganization algorithm is near optimum for constant reorganization cost and is superior for increasing reorganization cost. In addition, it can be applied to cases of unknown database lifetime and nonlinear performance deterioration. The simplicity, generality, and efficiency appear to make this good heuristic for database reorganization.","['S. B. Yao', 'Keshab Das', 'Toby J.

"The ternary T-gate can be used as a basic building block to construct both combinational and sequential circuits. For constructing ternary memory elements, however, the T-gate is required to be static hazard-free. A theoretical study is done on the necessary conditions for practical realization of the static-hazard-free T-gate. On the basis of the result obtained, the T-gate for memory elements can be realized. The T-gate is experimentally verified to be static hazard-free. The static-hazard-free T-gate obtained here can be used as building blocks to construct memory elements. We can easily construct various memory elements such as D flip-flap-flop (FFF), D master slave FFF, B master slave FFF, and counting FFF. They are operated satisfactorily. Using these memory elements, three different ternary counters are designed and realized. These ternary counters are superior to the binary ones in that the up-down counting can easily be carried out by one input signal.","['Tatsuo Higuchi', 'Michitaka Kameyama']",1,[],Static-hazard-free T-gate for ternary memory element and its application to ternary counters,international symposium on multiple valued logic,1976,c10a8be9-5ea7-41be-bc13-c524df9fe07a

"A series expansion of pitch periods is often suggested in order to reduce the information rate of speech signals. Considering speech signals that are sampled at a constant rate, this may be treated as a linear transformation of random vectors with varying length. For a constant length, it is commonly known how to determine the optimum basis vectors from the covariance matrix of the random vector. In this paper it is shown how to define and estimate a special covariance matrix which allows the determination of basis vectors that are especially suited for the expansion of variable length vectors. This expansion may be considered optimum in the sense that it has most of the favourable properties of the Karhunen-Loeve transformation (KL), without being restricted to a fixed dimension of the vector space.

Input speech is thus transformed into a sequence of the notations expressing the phonemes or phoneme groups every 10 ms. The sequence is again transformed into possible phonemic strings which are called input words henceforth and are convenient for the comparison with the contents of the dictionary. The Hamming's distance between each input word and each item of the contents of the dictionary is computed where the notations of phonemes and phoneme groups are expressed by 9 bits binary vectors. The item in the dictionary nearest to one of the input word is selected as the output of the recognition system. The experiments were carried out with the utterance of five speakers from whose utterances the standard patterns for P1, P2 and Pe3 distribution had been made. The recognition score was 96% for the 20 city names involving all kinds of phonemes. The speech samples were increased to 166 city names and 82% of the utterances of three speakers were correctly recognized by adding the possible combination of phonemes to every word. Next, 13 different speakers uttered 51 city names having long distance between each other, the recognition score was found to be 94% when the speakers were permitted to repeat their utterances for three times.","[""Ken'iti Kido"", 'Takahide Matsuoka', 'Jouji Miwa', 'Shozo Makino', 'Yoshinari Kanamori']",50,[],Spoken word recognition system for unlimited adult male speakers,"international conference on acoustics, speech, and signal processing",1976,a766a611-09e9-4e30-98ae-02391f98cdf4

"An approximation to the existing optimal algorithm for simultaneously tracking several moving targets is proposed which greatly reduces the required memory and number of calculations, but nevertheless retains reasonable accuracy (as is shown by analytic consideration and by Monte Carlo simulations) when the number of states is much greater than the number of targets. It is shown where errors arise in the approximation and how the errors tend to stabilize as the process evolves. Computational results on a highly idealized biological population surveillance problem are given that tend to confirm assertions concerning the relative computational efficiency and accuracy of the suboptimal rule in comparison to the optimal solution. A more realistic radar simulation study (20 targets and 10 000 states) is reported that suggests the scope of application of thc methodology proposed here.","['Sidney Yakowitz', 'Theodore L.

"A new system, that of matrix grammars, for two-dimensional picture processing, is introduced. A hierarchy, induced on Chomsky's is found. Language operations such as union, catenation (row and column), Kleene's closure (row and column), and homomorphisms are investigated. It is found that the smallest class of these languages may serve as the class of arrays, which is defined as the smallest class of arrays closed under union, catenation (row and column) and Kleene's closure (row and column). Eight possible ways of defining a matrix language are discussed and it is suggested that one of them may lead to a normal form of matrix grammars. The method is advantageous over others on several points. Perhaps the most interesting of all is that it provides a compromise between purely sequential methods, which take too much time for large arrays and purely parallel methods, which usually take too much hardware for large arrays.","['Patrick Shen-Pei Wang', 'William I.

Upper and lower bounds on processor utilization for the queueing model M/G/1/N are derived. The upper bound is equal to the utilization for constant service times and the lower bound is approached when the average number of operations per busy period approaches one. These bounds show that the form of the processing time distribution can have a substantial effect on processor utilization. We show that the utilization will be near the lower bound if there are a large number of short processing times. The variance does not always give an accurate indication of the effect of the distribution on utilization.,['Thomas G.

"This paper presents an algorithm for interconnecting two sets of terminals across an intervening channel. It is assumed that the routing is done on two distinct levels with all horizontal paths being assigned to one level and all vertical paths to the other. Connections between the levels are made through contact windows. A single net may result in many horizontal and vertical segments. Experimental results indicate that this algorithm is very successful in routing channels that contain severe constraints. Usually, the routing is accomplished within one track of the mathematical lower bound. The routing algorithm presented here was developed as part of LTX, a computer-aided design system for integrated circuit layout and was implemented on an HP-2100 minicomputer. A typical channel (300 terminals, 100 nets) can be routed in less than 5 seconds. Routing results are presented both for polycell chips under development at Bell Laboratories and for examples that exist in the published literature. For the latter, reductions of 10% in the wiring area were typical.",['David N.

"Shapley introduced an index theory for bimatrix games that oriented the paths generated by the Lemke-Howson algorithm and thus partitioned equilibrium points into two sets. Here we develop a similar orientation theory for a generalized complementary pivot algorithm and apply our results to bimatrix games, the linear complementarity problem, and fixed point algorithms. We provide the weakest known general sufficiency conditions (based on those of Garcia) for Lemke's algorithm to process the linear complementarity problem. We also show that if the linear complementarity version of a quadratic programming problem is solved and gives a Kuhn-Tucker solution, then the hessian of the objective function restricted to the subspace of active constraints has positive determinant. Finally we show that fixed point algorithms will only approximate fixed points of f at which the determinant of the Jacobian of f minus the identity has the appropriate sign.",['Michael J.

"The advent of relatively sophisticated information systems has made it possible for many businesses that keep inventories to know their needs very rapidly. However, the producers of these inventories have not all made comparable advances in scheduling production to meet the rapidly changing orders placed by their increasingly sophisticated customers. As a result, leadtimes have been growing rather than decreasing. Since in most cases the company needing the inventory cannot control the leadtime, it must either accept it or look for ways to mitigate its effect. This paper evaluates one way to cope with the problem of large or growing leadtimes.","['Matthew Rosenshine', 'Duncan Obee']",86,,Analysis of a Standing Order Inventory System with Emergency Orders,Operations Research,1976,df3e0bc5-877e-45f3-a16b-45986f119ed2

"Ward beds are a primary resource under the control of hospital management. We develop a method for determining an optimum distribution of beds in a ward by assuming that ward patients can be classified into two categories, that admissions follow Poisson distribution, and that length of stay in the ward follows the negative exponential distribution. After defining a cut-off level as ""the number of beds beyond which type 2 non-serious patients are not admitted,"" we develop a system of differential and difference birth and death process equations for the process. An objective function made up of shortage and holding costs is then developed and optimized for various values of cut-off priority level. An application of this model to a university teaching hospital in Cleveland is illustrated. The model is then extended to a situation where overflows are temporarily housed in a buffer accommodation or inappropriate ward.","['Augustine O. Esogbue', 'Amar J.

There is no initial production capacity or inventory, but the capacity and production may be increased at the beginning of each discrete time period. We assume that the capacity and production are nondecreasing over the time periods. The total time discounted costs to be minimized include the capacity expansion, production, inventory carrying, and idle capacity costs, which are assumed to be concave. The problem is to determine an optimal capacity expansion and production schedule, together with the associated inventory carrying and idle capacity schedules.

"The viability of packet switched computer communication has been demonstrated. The potential for more effective computing through resource sharing and load leveling is evident. Realization of this potential requires expanded user support to reduce or eliminate much of the need for users to learn the command languages of the hosts being accessed and of the communications subnetwork. Such a capability can be provided by a mediating agent providing ease of access to resources and control of resource access---a role traditionally ascribed to an operating system in the context of an individual computer system. This mediating agent, hereafter termed a Network Operating System (NOS), requires careful exploration to determine its appropriate interaction with the operating systems of the hosts within the network.

"The problem of correlation degradation resulting from the motion of a transiting target is addressed. The target is assumed to emit a narrowband signal which is remotely received by two or more signal sensors. The signal compensation controls available in correlation processing are a fixed time delay (to align the two received signals) and a fixed time scale-factor shift (to compensate for doppler difference). Although these controls have proven adequate over small integration integrals, the notion induced degradation will become increasingly severe as the coherence interval is extended. The object of the paper is to determine quantitatively the expected correlation degradation as a function of the system geometry, the signal frequency, the correlation integration time and the nature and characteristics of the target track. For a given system geometry, signal frequency, and anticipated notional characteristics then, an appropriate integration time can be chosen to optimize the correlation processor in some useful sense.",['A Gerlach'],50,,Motion induced coherence degradation in passive systems,"international conference on acoustics, speech, and signal processing",1976,ca342a55-612f-4a79-97cb-9bcf85a5dc99

"The programming language Alphard is designed to provide support for both the methodologies of “well-structured” programming and the techniques of formal program verification. Language constructs allow a programmer to isolate an  abstraction , specifying its behavior publicly while localizing knowledge about its implementation. The verification of such an abstraction consists of showing that its implementation behaves in accordance with its public specifications; the abstraction can then be used with confidence in constructing other programs, and the verification of that use employs only the public specifications.   This paper introduces Alphard by developing and verifying a data structure definition and a program that uses it. It shows how each language construct contributes to the development of the abstraction and discusses the way the language design and the verification methodology were tailored to each other. It serves not only as an introduction to Alphard, but also as an example of the symbiosis between verification and methodology in language design. The strategy of program structuring, illustrated for Alphard, is also applicable to most of the “data abstraction” mechanisms now appearing.","['Wm. A. Wulf', 'Ralph L.

From the digitized binary picture of the line drawing portraying a given three-dimensional object a description is generated in terms of a set of ""cardinal points"" (which are key points occurring at the bends and open ends of the object) and a set of direction vectors associated with them. The skeleton for the given view is obtained as an ordered sequence of ""slope-code"" numbers by tracking between the cardinal points. A set of transformations is defined on the sequence and the direction vectors to get the skeleton of the view that results from rotation.

"In this work we explore a number of questions arising in the Gaussian two-category classification problem when the common covariance matrix is unknown and must be estimated in order to approximate the hyperplane for decisionmaking, which is optimum for the true covariance matrix. Computed curves and, in some cases, closed form expressions are presented for describing the performance of such adaptive systems as a function of data dimensionality and learning sample size. In particular, we show that a considerable improvement in performance can be realized through the use of some {\em a priori} knowledge of covariance matrix structure. We use the adaptive filter output signal-to-interference noise power ratio (SIR) as a measure of detection performance to compare estimators designed for a weakly stationary stochastic process (Toeplitz form covariance matrix) with an estimator designed for a general sample covariance matrix. The ratio of expected SIR performance for a generalized covariance estimate to that for a filter which is optimum for the true covariance matrix is shown to be \cong [1 - N/N_{s} - 7/N_{s}] , where N is the filter (data) dimension, and N_{s} is the sample size. For a constrained Toeplitz form covariance matrix estimate, it is argued that the expected SIR approaches the optimum SIR as \cong [1 - \pi' (N;B)/N_{s} - 7 \pi'(N;B)/NN_{s}] , with \pi'(N;B) \cong A + (B + 1) \ln N + 1/2N , where A = 0.577 is Euler's constant, and 0 \leq B  is the input data correlation time normalized by the sampling period. Therefore, the constrained Toeplitz covariance matrix estimate appears to operate with an ""effective sample size"" equal to N'_{s} \cong [N/ \pi' (N;B)]N_{s} and offers the potential of high expected SIR at a sample size N_{s} for which the generalized estimator may provide poor results. The effective sample size is shown to be {\em even greater} if the dimensionality of the constrained Toeplitz covariance matrix estimate is tailored to the input data correlation time in the sense that only a band of lags about the main diagonal is estimated. In this case, N'_{s} \cong (kN^{2})N_{s} , where k is a constant, independent of N. An estimate of the computational error associated with the results, and due primarily to a quadratic approximation employed for the SIR, is derived and compared with the normal statistical error. Because closed form solutions for adaptive filter performance generally involve tedious calculations and involved expressions, certain other workers have relied on a similar approximation, but without the benefit of knowing the quality of the approximation for a given N and N_{s} . Insight is also provided into other matters such as the effect of the specific form of the category mean value vector (signal) on adaptation performance. It is felt that many application areas will benefit from the results presented here, e.g., biomedical image recognition, earth resource satellite multispectral data classification, adaptive linear prediction, adaptive antenna array processing, etc. The manner in which the results impact the array processing area is discussed in some detail.","['S.

"Chess has served as a convenient vehicle for studying cognition and perception (see de Groot [1965], Chase and Simon [1973]) as well as machine intelligence. Perhaps  the  central question for both of these research uses of chess is: How much chess-specific knowledge does it take to play at a given level of competence, for example, at the master level? It is difficult to say what chess-specific knowledge is, and it certainly consists of different types of knowledge, that must be considered independently of each other (for example, ""book knowledge"" obtained by studying chess books is quite different from experience obtained in over-the-board play). Even if one succeeds in defining what ""chess-specific knowledge"" is, there remains the difficulty of measuring it. Because of these difficulties, any approach to measuring the amount of knowledge possessed by a practitioner of a craft must be based on questionable assumptions, and any result obtained is subject to uncertainty and criticism. Only the inherent interest of the question posed justifies reporting on a rough and inconclusive experiment designed to answer one aspect of the tantalizing question: How much chess-specific knowledge does it take to play at a given level of competence?",['Jürg Nievergelt'],7,[],Information content of chess positions,Intelligence\/sigart Bulletin,1977,d67e1bb9-7929-4d45-8687-8458b0fe5889

"Because of the event-driven, nature of asynchronous, concurrent processes, production systems (PS's) are an attractive modeling tool. The system of interest can be modeled with a large number of independent states, with independent actions, and tile knowledge base can be conveniently encoded declaratively. However, asynchronous, concurrent processes normally have strict requirements for inter-process communication and coordination; this requires a substantial degree of inter-rule communication in the PS. The result of this is that a complex control structure is embedded in the short term memory (STM); this is generally considered unattractive for a number of reasons. This paper proposes a separate, explicit control structure for modeling asynchronous, concurrent processes With PS's. Specifically, the use of a Petri net is addressed. A system of asynchronous, concurrent processes can be modeled using 'PS's to model the individual processes or events and using a Petri net to model the relationships between the processes. Furthermore, a hierarchy of such networks is proposed; an allowable production rule action is the instantiation of another network. This is supported with a structured, hierarchial STM.",['Michael D.

"Pipelined computer architecture has received considerable attention since the 1960s when the need for faster and more cost-effective systems became critical. The merit of pipelining is that it can help to match the speeds of various subsystems without duplicating the cost of the entire system involved. As technology evolves, faster and cheaper LSI circuits become available, and the future of pipelining, either in a simple or complex form, becomes more promising.       This paper reviews the many theoretical considerations and problems behind pipelining, surveying and comparing various representative pipeline machines that operate in either sequential or vector pipeline mode, the practical solutions adopted, and the tradeoffs involved. The performance of a simple pipe, the physical speed limitation, and the control structures for penalty-incurring events are analyzed separately. The problems faced by the system designers are tackled, including buffering, busing structur, branching, and interrupt handling. Aspects of sequential and vector processing are studied. Fundamental advantages of vector processing are unveiled, and additional requirements (costs) are discussed to establish a criterion for the tradeoff between sequential and vector pipeline processing. Finally, two recent machines (the CRAY-1 and the Amdahl 470 V/6 systems) are presented to demonstrate how complex pipeline techniques can be used and how simple but advantageous pipeline concepts can be exploited.","['C.

"Two approaches to the problem of pronoun resolution are presented. The first is a naive algorithm that works by traversing the surface parse trees of the sentences of the text in a particular order looking for noun phrases of the correct gender and number. The algorithm is shown to incorporate many, though not all, of the constraints on co-referentiality between a nonreflective pronoun and a possible antecedent, which have been discovered recently by linguists. The algorithm clearly does not work in all cases, but the results of an examination of several hundred examples from published texts show that it performs remarkably well.In the second approach, it is shown how pronoun resolution is handled in a comprehensive system for semantic analysis of English texts. The system consists of four basic semantic operations which work by accessing a data base of 'World knowledge"" inferences, which are drawn selectively and in a context-dependent way in response to the operations. The first two operations seek to satisfy the demands made by predicates on the nature of their arguments and to discover the relations between sentences. The third operation - knitting - recognizes and merges redundant expressions. These three operations frequently result in a pronoun reference being resolved as a by-product. The fourth operation seeks to resolve those pronouns not resolved by the first three. It involves a bidirectional search of the text and 'World knowledge"" for an appropriate chain of inference and utilizes the efficiency of the naive algorithm.Four examples, including the classic examples of Winograd and Charniak, are presented that demonstrate pronoun resolution within the semantic approach.",['Jerry R.

The study indicated that with minor modification of file designs, such as those implemented in the Syracuse Information Retrieval Experiment (SIRE), document retrieval systems could efficiently provide users with output lists on which the rank order of a document is a good indicator of its probable relevance to the user's information need. The study found that relevant documents were ranked significantly higher than nonrelevant documents in the set of documents retrieved in response to a Boolean query. By utilizing an augmented inverted file design the variable incremental cost for ranked output was only ten cents per query. There was no increased user effort.","['Terry Noreault', 'Matthew B.

"We investigate a model for a general single server queueing system operating under the earliest due date scheduling rule, which can be interpreted more generally as a dynamic priority queue-discipline. We consider both preemptive resume and non preemptive disciplines within this framework. No assumptions are made about the distributions of interarrival times and service times of customers in this model, so that characterizations can be derived for arbitrary systems. The analysis depends on suitably defining the concepts of the server's workload and busy period of the system with respect to the priority classes involved. Equations are developed for the virtual waiting times of customers arriving at the system at any time t , and these imply properties of virtual lateness. In the case of an M / G /1 system, expressions for mean waiting times in transient and steady state are derived, and these are found to be analogous to the expressions derived by Cobham in the special case of static priorities. Bounds for expected waiting lime and lateness are obtained, and the increased flexibility of optimization with respect to dynamic priorities is indicated. The results in the paper extend to the case of a number of servers in parallel instead of a single server.",['Henry M.

"One central goal of decision theory is to provide a rational basis for decisionmaking. The ADDAM (Adaptive Dynamic Decision Aiding Methodology) system is designed to aid the decisionmaker (DM) in performing dynamic decision tasks. The ADDAM system provides real-time dynamic assessments of multiple utilities as the DM performs a dynamic decision task. ADDAM continuously tracks the DM's decision responses and uses adaptive pattern classification techniques to learn his utilities for their outcomes. These utilities are then used to provide decision aiding in the form of maximum expected utility decision recommendations. An experimental study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the decision aiding system in a realistic decision task. Aided subjects showed significantly less deviation from their own maximum expected utility and substantially less within group-variance than did unaided subjects. Aided subjects also had a greater decision output. The adaptive utility estimates upon which the aiding was based converged rapidly to stable values. The ADDAM system was found to provide an appropriate, systematic, and testable approach to decision aiding. ADDAM aids the operator by organizing his own in-context decision behavior into a systematic mathematical framework. Such aiding is applicable to a wide variety of systems in which deficiencies of human decisionmakers may be overcome by techniques to augment human memory and logic processes.","['Richard Weisbrod', 'Kent B Davis', 'Amos Freedy']",3,['8a003cdf-fcf1-4f94-adaf-0c1e8004c1a6'],Adaptive Utility Assessment in Dynamic Decision Processes: An Experimental Evaluation of Decision Aiding,systems man and cybernetics,1977,8bd134b7-d057-4ef6-98ce-81769bdaae9b

The heuristic is an extension of the highly successful one of Lin and Kernighan for the single traveling salesman problem. Computational experience with widely tested vehicle dispatch problems indicates that the proposed heuristic consistently yields better solutions than existing heuristics that have appeared in the literature.

"Recursive filter design techniques are described and developed for finite impulse filters using finite field arithmetic. The finite fields considered have the form GF(q^{2}) , the Galois field of q^{2} elements, and are analogous to the field of complex numbers when q is a prime such that (-1) is not a quadratic residue. These filters can be designed to yield either a desired finite impulse or finite frequency response function. This filtering technique has other possible applications, including the encoding or decoding of information and signal design. Infinite signal trains can be decomposed naturally into orthogonal sequences which may be useful in the encoding and decoding process and may provide another approach to convolutional coding. Since the recursive filters developed here do not have the accumulation of round-off or truncation error that one might expect in recursive computations, such filters are noise-free transducers in the sense of Shannon.","['Hideo Murakami', 'Irving S.

"The problem of stability of an adaptive differential pulse code modulation (ADPCM) system is considered from two viewpoints. First, it is demonstrated that the step-size adaptation algorithm of a certain class of ADPCM's can be characterized by the system's response to step: function inputs. The degree of ""hunting"" or ""oscillation"" provides an indication of the deterministic stability of the algorithm, and algorithms are presented that minimize these effects. Secondly, stationary random processes with rational spectral densities are used to study stochastic stability of ADPCM. It is shown that for certain ADPCM's the time-averaged mean-absolute quantizing noise is bounded, that the joint distribution of the input and decoded output processes possesses a stationary distribution, that this joint distribution converges to the stationary distribution from an arbitrary starting point, and that the mean-absolute quantizing noise is finite under the stationary distribution.","['Lawrence H.

"Brosgol [Br] formalizes the notion that parsing methods can be classified by the positions at which production rules are recognized. In an LL parser, each rule is recognized at the left end, before the rule's yield has been read; in an LR parser, a rule is recognized at its right end, after its yield has been read; and in an LC parser a rule is recognized after the yield of its ""left corner"" has been read. We generalize on these techniques by allowing the user to specify arbitrarily for each production rule the position at which that rule is to be recognized. The resulting GLC or generalized left corner technique includes the LR, LL, LC, and ELC methods as special cases. It also allows for less conventional parsing strategies, such as grammar splitting [K] with certain component grammars parsed top-down and the others parsed bottom-up, as suggested in [AU].This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give some necessary background and notation. Section 3 defines GLC parsing. A canonical GLC(k) parsing technique can be defined analogous to the LR(k) technique. However, the resulting parsers tend to be unacceptably large. We therefore restrict our attention to the SGLC(k), or simple generalized left corner parsing technique, which is analogous to the SLR(k) technique of DeRemer [D]. We give an algorithm for the construction of SGLC(k) parsing tables and prove that the resulting parser is correct.In Section 4 we develop some potentially useful properties of SGLC(1) parsers. We show that there is a well-defined leftmost position at which each production rule can be recognized, and that a minimal left corner parser can be constructed which recognizes each rule as early as possible. We derive a simple expression relating the size (number of states) of an SGLC(1) parser to the size of the corresponding SLR(1) parser. If G is not left-recursive, then the minimal left-corner parser is the smallest parser for G in this class, while the SLR(1) parser is the largest.In Section 5 we extend the techniques 5 of [HSU] to give an O(n 2 ) algorithm to test whether a grammar with no left recursion is SGLC(1), and if so to compute its minimal left corners.",['Alan J.

"The performance of a disk system is often measured in terms of the length of the waiting line or queue of requests for each of the system's spindles. Thus it is natural to formulate and analyze queueing models of disk systems. While most disk systems have certain characteristics, such as channel interference and concurrent seeks, in common, previous analyses have always been begun from scratch, without exploiting this commonality. We introduce a general queueing model for disk systems, which incorporates the characteristics common to most disk systems, and use it in the approximate analyses of models of the IBM 2314 and 3330 disk systems.

"Programming is divided into three major categories with increasing complexity of reasoning in program validation: sequential programming, multiprogramming, and real-time programming. By adhering to a strict programming discipline and by using a suitable high-level language molded after this discipline, the complexity of reasoning about concurrency and execution time constraints may be drastically reduced.

"One of the major functions of State and Federal Public Health agencies is the collection and maintenance of large amounts of data. The utilization of this data for research and planning may be impaired by such factors as: lack of organization and accessibility of the data, users lack of knowledge of statistical and operations research techniques, inability to determine important variables from a large selection, and the need to present results in a form which is understandable and useful to the general public.This paper presents interactive graphics approaches which are designed to aid the public health planner and administrator through presentation of data in map and table form. Interactive graphics is a form of real time computing in which all or part of the input and output operations are handled through a graphics terminal. The systems described below present statistics for different civil divisions and allow the user to display and compare data from a large set of variables. These variables include locational data such as the position of emergency medical services, hospitals, cities and towns; quantities such as travel distance, travel time, service area, and service population; and summary statistics. The display is controlled either through light pen activated commands or the use of a ""button board"". The systems have been applied to problems in administrative area designation and emergency service placement.The use of interactive graphics allows the public health planner and administrator to handle large data bases with minimal expertise. Data may be reviewed quickly and useful variable selected. These systems also allow for the maximum use of the administrators experience and knowledge of the areas particular needs and qualitative factors by allowing direct interface to the data. These systems require a minimal amount of training to use, thus allowing interested public groups to use them to develop and compare different solutions to health planning and administrative problems.","['Christopher Willard', 'Jay R.

"An interactive computer graphics method has been developed for the rapid generation of arbitrary shaped three-dimensional surfaces. The method is a synthesis of spline theory and algorithms, an interactive means for man-machine communication, and software for static or dynamic graphics display. The basic technique employed is a modified lofting method in which sectional curves are represented by uniform B-splines and the surface is interpolated between sections by Cardinal splines. Among the features of this method are algorithm, which enable interactive modification of the B-spline representation of the sectional curves. At all stages of the process, the spatial information is graphically displayed to the user. Complex surfaces can be created by the combination of a number of shapes that have been separately generated and automatically joined.

"This paper describes a management/computer interactive system for the planning and control of the development of computer software programs on a large scale.   Linked planning (PERT type) networks are used to represent the basic information model. This composite network is formed within the computer from individual networks using computerized library techniques. The model then represents the overall definition of the projected work load.   This information model is then manipulated by varying both the planning data (resources available, etc.) and scheduling parameters. Multi-project scheduling methods, using advanced resource allocation procedures, are then employed to rapidly obtain basic planning information (manpower loading, completion dates, costs, etc.).   These basic concepts are established within a framework of a flexible system which responds to changes in product requirements, resource availability levels and project priorities. The interaction between management and the computer based network planning system enables the work to be effectively planned and provides a sound basis for subsequent control.",['H. S.

"It is proven that under the assumption of independent references, the (apparently analytically and computationally intractable) expected LRU (least recently used) miss ratio with main memory size CAP can be approximated arbitrarily dosely by the (analytically and computationally tractable) expected working-set miss ratio with expected working-set size CAP, as the size of the database goes to infinity. Their common asymptotic value is given by a tractable formula involving integrals. An immediate corollary of the representation is the asymptotic independence of miss ratio from page size in the independent reference model and in some generalizations of this model. This result also has implications about the effect on miss ratio of variable or fixed partitioning of main memory, in case of multiprogramming. Furthermore, in certain database environments, we can answer the question as to how the size of main memory must vary in order to maintain the same miss ratio, when the size of the database increases. The methods of this paper are extended to give an asymptotic formula for the miss ratio under VMIN, the optimal variable-space page replacement algorithm under demand paging.",['Ronald Fagin'],50,"['2a37721b-4b22-4aef-878b-8d9a88bdd740', '4d502779-1d92-491c-9c9b-6116e22e3dc3', '6fc06346-1f33-4f93-9b07-37cc577f31a4', 'ab9ce226-79c7-45b0-a665-5bd354630f7b', 'e6a4e263-2f90-4e25-b0fb-63bf6f963f3f', 'e9e628db-7a98-4f31-9af2-aca48572e303', 'f2a1bd6e-841b-4964-b567-234d1d804b50']",Asymptotic Miss Ratios over Independent References,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,1977,7406d11b-3138-4418-9f04-65fc0af8cfb9

"Abstract#R##N##R##N#The implementation of the SNOBOL4 programming language requires some scheme for dynamic allocation and reclamation of storage. This paper describes the method used in a machine-dependent implementation of SNOBOL4 called SITBOL. Available storage is divided into two regions: one for the allocation of storage for permanent or immovable objects and one for objects that are subject to reclamation. Reclamation is accomplished by a four-phase algorithm, which includes marking, address adjustment and compaction. The reclamation process is supplemented by several heuristics that reduce the cost of reclamation and increase the amount of storage reclaimed. The storage overhead of the technique is analysed and compared with an alternate method. Some empirical measurements of actual SNOBOL4 programs are given that substantiate the results of the analysis.",['David R.

"It is very often more convenient and more meaningful to specify a set of structural descriptions analytically rather than generatively, i.e., by specifying a set of constraints each structured description in the set has to satisfy. Peters and Ritchie (7) have shown that if context-sensitive rules are used only for ""analysis"" then the string language of the set of trees is still context-free. In this paper,we have generalized this result by considering context-free rules constrained by Boolean combinations of proper analysis predicates and domination predicates. These rules, called ""local transformations"" not onlymake precise an informal and briefly discussed notion of Chomsky (2), but also, generalize it in an appropriate manner. It is shown that the Peters-Ritchie result can be generalized to local transforma- tions. Linguistic relevance of this result has been also briefly discussed. Results in this paper are relevant to the following situation: Patterns of a class, say A, may be difficult to characterize generatively; but, it may be possible to specify a suitable (nontrivial) augmentation, say B, of the class A, such thatB can be easily characterized generatively, and thenA is characterized by stating some restrictions on the class B. This suggests possible applications to programming languages and pattern description languages.","['Aravind K. Joshi', 'Leon S.

"The performance of Channel block codes for a general channel is studied by examining the relationship between the rate of a code, the joint composition of pairs of codewords, and the probability of decoding error. At fixed rate, lower bounds and upper bounds, both on minimum Bhattacharyya distance between codewords and on minimum equivocation distance between codewords, are derived. These bounds resemble, respectively, the Gilbert and the Elias bounds on the minimum Hamming distance between codewords. For a certain large class of channels, a lower bound on probability of decoding error for low-rate channel codes is derived as a consequence of the upper bound on Bhattacharyya distance. This bound is always asymptotically tight at zero rate. Further, for some channels, it is asymptotically tighter than the straight line bound at low rates. Also studied is the relationship between the bounds on codeword composition for arbitrary alphabets and the expurgated bound for arbitrary channels having zero error capacity equal to zero. In particular, it is shown that the expurgated reliability-rate function for blocks of letters is achieved by a product distribution whenever it is achieved by a block probability distribution with strictly positive components.",['Richard E.

However, for real world multicommodity network flow problems, this inverse may become quite large. In addition, this matrix may be quite dense even though the working basis may be sparse.

"A within-subjects experimental design was used to test the effect of two variables on program understanding. The independent variables were complexity of control flow and paragraphing of the source code. Understanding was measured by having the subjects memorize the code for a fixed time and reconstruct the code verbatim. Also some subjects were asked to describe the function of the program after completing their reconstruction. The two groups of subjects for the experiment were students from an introductory programming class and from a graduate class in programming languages.   The major findings were that paragraphing of the source had no effect for either group of subjects but that programs with simplified control flow were easier for the computer science students to understand as measured by their ability to reconstruct the programs. The dependent variable, rated accuracy of their description of the programs functions, did not differ as a function of either independent variable.

"Mathematical programming applications often require an objective function to be approximated by one of simpler form so that an available computational approach can be used. An a priori bound is derived on the amount of error (suitably defined) which such an approximation can induce. This leads to a natural criterion for selecting the “best” approximation from any given class. We show that this criterion is equivalent for all practical purposes to the familiar Chebyshev approximation criterion. This gains access to the rich legacy on Chebyshev approximation techniques, to which we add some new methods for cases of particular interest in mathematical programming.

"An algorithm is presented that searches for the location, “ i l” of the first occurrence of a character string, “ pat ,” in another string, “ string .” During the search operation, the characters of  pat  are matched starting with the last character of  pat . The information gained by starting the match at the end of the pattern often allows the algorithm to proceed in large jumps through the text being searched. Thus the algorithm has the unusual property that, in most cases, not all of the first  i  characters of  string  are inspected. The number of characters actually inspected (on the average) decreases as a function of the length of  pat . For a random English pattern of length 5, the algorithm will typically inspect  i /4 characters of  string  before finding a match at  i . Furthermore, the algorithm has been implemented so that (on the average) fewer than  i  +  patlen  machine instructions are executed. These conclusions are supported with empirical evidence and a theoretical analysis of the average behavior of the algorithm.

"Abstract#R##N##R##N#One of the fundamental problems in information science is to distinguish various objects, such as books or journal articles, on the basis of associated values, such as authors and titles. Where the values fail to distinguish two distinct objects, we say that the objects are ambiguous under the given value assignment. To obtain a measure of of ambiguity, it is only necessary to count the number of ways that the objects can be arranged for each set of ambiguous objects, multiply these counts and take logarithms. It is shown that such an approach leads to a measure in the formal sense and that the measure depends only on the definition of equality of values so that it can be simply extended to sets of values and ordered sets of values. It is also shown that it is possible to construct a function of ambiguity that one can call information and that the information loss that occurs when distinct values are grouped into equivalence classes, as in the use of search and sort keys, is also a measure. Finally, it is shown that ambiguity and information as here defined are directly related to Shannon's definition of information, thus tieing this approach to that portion of information theory associated with the derivation of optimal distributions frequently used in information science models.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#“… if one is concerned with messages to be transmitted, and if there is reasonable freedom in coding the message for transmission, entropy is clearly a quantity of interest and importance.

"The communications aspects of a distributed architecture for transaction processing are described. The architecture is aimed at transaction processing on physically distributed data bases, where most of the hits on a given component of the data base come from a single geographic region. The architecture is physically based on a homogeneous set of host minicomputers, a message-switched communications subnetwork (loop or packet-switched), and a set of network interface processors which connect the hosts to the communications subnetwork. It is logically based on two primitives; all data objects (including messages) are segments and all control objects (including files) are tasks. Each task runs in a private virtual space and all inter-task communication is done by passing message segments. Segment passing is done by a single message-switching task in each host, assisted by the interface processors and communications subnetwork where necessary.

These proof justifications are written as part of the program, along with the executable code and correctness specifications. A notation is presented in which code, specifications, and justifications are interwoven. For example, if a program contains a specification 3x P(x), the program also contains a justification that exhibits the particulat value of x that makes P true. Analogously, justifications may be used to state how universally quantified formulas are to be instantiated when they are used as hypotheses. Programs so justifiled may be verified by proving quantifier-free formulas. Additional classes of justifications serve related ends. Formally, justifications reduce correctness to a decidable theory. Informally, justifications establish the connection between the executable code and correctness specifications, documenting the reasoning on which the correctness is based.",['Ben Wegbreit'],50,"['1cda4bde-b8d9-4b2d-bfdb-d9bf578a2852', '5e6cb59c-e510-48de-a6cb-b6413ae84710', 'a603f86e-45e4-46f1-83b5-f132c8a765c0']",Constructive Methods in Program Verification,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,1977,cb2d5385-cb45-42f0-bde2-09a5ed1b7d36

"This paper describes the fundamentals and some of the details of task communication in DEMOS, the operating system for the CRAY-1 computer being developed at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. The communication mechanism is a message system with several novel features. Messages are sent from one task to another over  links . Links are the primary protected objects in the system; they provide both message paths and optional data sharing between tasks. They can be used to represent other objects with capability-like access controls. Links point to the tasks that created them. A task that creates a link determines its contents and possibly restricts its use. A link may be passed from one task to another along with a message sent over some other link subject to the restrictions imposed by the creator of the link being passed. The link based message and data sharing system is an attractive alternative to the semaphore or monitor type of shared variable based operating system on machines with only very simple memory protection mechanisms or on machines connected together in a network.","['Forest Baskett', 'John H.

"A new representation, called an exponential Fourier density, of a probability density on a circle, S^{1} is introduced. It is shown that a density of bounded variation on S^{1} can be approximated as closely as desired by such a representation in the space of square-integrable functions on S^{1} . The exponential Fourier densities have the desirable feature of being closed under the operation of taking conditional distributions. Facilitated by the use of these densities, finite-dimensional, recursive, and optimal estimation and detection schemes are derived for some simple models including a PSK communication system. A deficiency of the exponential Fourier densities is that they are not closed under convolution.

"Systems analysis is the examination of a problem situation in order to define the requirements of a solution, often computerized, to that problem. The diversity of problems and the constraints of computing technology require that a problem be thoroughly analyzed in order to insure that the problem is clearly understood. Then, and only then it can be determined how computing technology can be applied to solve the identified problem. Therefore, systems analysis education teaches the discipline of clear and complete problem definition.   Several recent developments offer new perspectives for systems analysis education.

"The problem of discovering invariant assertions of programs is explored in light of the fixpoint approach in the static analysis of programs, Cousot [1977a], Cousot[1977b].   In section 2 we establish the lattice theoric foundations upon which the synthesis of invariant assertions is based. We study the resolution of a fixpoint system of equations by Jacobi's successive approximations method. Under continuity hypothesis we show that any chaotic iterative method converges to the optimal solution. In section 3 we study the deductive semantics of programs. We show that a system of logical forward equations can be associated with a program using the predicate transformer rules which define the semantics of elementary instructions. The resolution of this system of semantic equations by chaotic iterations leads to the optimal invariants which exactly define the semantics of this program. Therefore these optimal invariants can be used for total correctness proofs (section 4). Next we show that usually a system of inequations is used as a substitute for the system of equations. Hence the solutions to this system of inequations are approximate invariants which can only be used for proofs of partial correctness (section 5). In section 6 we show that symbolic execution of programs consists in fact in solving the semantic equations associated with this program. The construction of the symbolic execution tree corresponds to the chaotic successive approximations method. Therefore symbolic execution permits optimal invariant assertions to be discovered provided that one can pass to the limit, that is consider infinite paths in the symbolic execution tree. Induction nrinciDles can be used for that purpose. In section 7 we show how difference equations can be utilized to discover the general term of the sequence of successive approximations so that optimal invariants are obtained by a mere passage to the limit. In section 8 we show that an approximation of the optimal solution to a fixpoint system of equations can be obtained by strengthening the term of a chaotic iteration sequence. This formalizes the synthesis of approximate invariants by heuristic methods. Various examples provide a helpful intuitive support to the technical sections.","['Patrick Cousot', 'Radhia Cousot']",155,"['03872aeb-1eff-4678-866d-b019bf1934d3', '4d242a89-923e-4de3-a542-beef3957502b', '68a4d543-cb5b-49b3-a6ae-4c85c1dca6b2', '9a4984f9-27d4-47eb-8bc8-0469bf540f94', 'cf5ba6c2-2c92-47d9-89cf-b8a801a66e55', 'd9dfe41e-c1f4-46e3-b779-5df328817fbb']",Automatic synthesis of optimal invariant assertions: Mathematical foundations,Sigplan Notices,1977,801aa7d0-baec-4337-abf0-d87dc2f43cda

The functional form of payoffs that yield state-variable-independent optimal strategies to this Lanchester-type differential game is shown to be determined by a linear first-order partial differential equation. Kawara's main result was that the time at which an optimal strategy tells one to switch from concentrating all supporting fires on enemy artillery to all on enemy infantry does not depend on the force levels (provided that neither side's supporting units can be all destroyed before a certain time).

"An algebraic approach to the determination of consistent parameter estimates of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) discrete systems for general type input sequences is developed. It is shown that a special canonical structure for the system matrices exist such that the parameter estimation equations decouple into p independent subsystem equations. This results in a significant reduction in the dimension of the data matrix and allows simple algebraic equations to be derived relating system parameters, least-squares parameter estimates, and noise parameters. It is shown that the solution of these equations yields consistent parameter estimates which have rapid initial convergence towards the correct parameter values.","['Erik V. Bohn', 'Martin K.

"We suggest that the concept of a  strategy  can profitably be viewed as  knowledge about how to select from among a set of plausibly useful knowledge sources , and explore the framework for knowledge organization which this implies. We describe  meta rules , a means of encoding strategies that has been implemented in a program called TEIRESIAS, and explore their utility and contribution to problem solving performance.   Meta rules are also considered in the broader context of a tool for programming. We show that they can be considered a medium for expressing the criteria for retrieval of knowledge sources in a program, and hence can be used to define control regimes. The utility of this as a programming mechanism is considered.   Finally, we describe the technique of  content-directed invocation  used by meta rules, and consider its use as a way of implementing strategies. It is also considered in historical perspective as a knowledge source invocation technique, and its advantage over some existing mechanisms like goal-directed invocation is considered.

"There are n tasks lo be scheduled for processing on a set of identical parallel machines. We are interested in minimizing the mean flow time, which is related to the sum of the finishing times of all tasks. When tasks can be processed in any order, optimal schedules can be constructed in On log n time on any number of identical machines. With arbitrary precedence constraints the problem becomes NP-complete even on one machine. However, for series-parallel precedence constraints an On log n algorithm is known for one machine. We show that on two or more machines, the problem is NP-complete even if the precedence constraints are tree-like.

"Conventional integrated circuit packaging techniques which use pins for input-output have several disadvantages, which are becoming increasingly important as more logic is put on a chip. Recent intensive development of optical links for long distance communications suggests that they could be used between integrated circuits, to alleviate the bottleneck created by the connection technology, so that LSI technology can be further exploited. However, the complex linkages between integrated circuit cannot be economically realized by just replacing each wire by an optical link; rather a ""bus organization"" should be developed so that, by time multiplexing one optical link that threads just once through each integrated circuit, different time slots can be used to realize any necessary transfer. Additionally, the time slices are controlled by a microprogram, so that ""wiring changes"" can be realized by program changes.

"Abstract#R##N##R##N#Despite a breakthrough in library cataloging of files of machine-readable social science data (directions are expected in the next Anglo-American Cataloging Rules), the U.S. system for delivering information about data files still needs strengthening. While descriptive cataloging of locally held files by research libraries should prove helpful, suppliers' restrictions on “rediffusion” of data reduce the value of a national union catalog. Subject cataloging is also a problem, although a new form heading for data files would improve the usefulness of the Library of Congress Subject Headings. The greatest improvement would be inclusion of abstracts and indexing of the files in a national bibliographic service with on-line search capability, especially one that could provide the codebooks required by those wanting to reuse others' data. With NTIS furnishing a prototype, ERIC is here proposed as a model of what is needed.

"Two methods are introduced for reducing additive noise in approximately piecewise constant images. In the first method, the correct gray level of a point P is estimated by a weighted average of the gray levels of P's immediate neighbors. To assign these weights for a given P so that the local averaging operation does not blur the image, the presence of any edges or lines passing through P's neighborhood must be determined. For example, when an edge is present, only those points on P's side of the edge should be used. In general, the distribution of gray levels in P's neighborhood will suggest many possible line and edge configurations which can be used to compute the weight distribution for the averaging operation. The averaging is performed in parallel over the entire image and is iterated for additional smoothing. The second method is a relaxation labeling formulation which can be psed in cases of more severe noise. Each point is now assigned a vector of probabilities over its allowable gray level set. These probabilities are updated as weighted averages of the gray level probabilities at neighboring points. Once again the presence of lines and edges determines how the contribution from each neighboring point is weighted. Examples demonstrating both methods are given.","['Lev Aa', 'Steven W.

"A variety of likelihood ratios are derived for detecting Gauss-Markov and finite-state Markov sequences in additive Gaussian noise. The Bayesian recursions appropriate to related filtering problems are exploited, together with ""known-form"" likelihood ratios, to obtain the desired results. In the derivation of a discrete-time Gauss-Markov likelihood ratio, a ""pure"" causal estimator-correlator structure is sought and a ""locally stable"" state estimator is encountered that is of some interest in its own right. The likelihood ratio is ""pure"" in the sense that the locally stable estimator is used in precisely the same manner as the stored replica is used in known-form signal detection problems to form the likelihood ratio. Consequently, the likelihood ratio is devoid of the extra data-dependent term that arises whenever one uses least squares state estimators to form the likelihood ratio statistic. The locally stable estimator equalizes, within a constant related to the {\em a priori} and {\em a posteriori} filtering error covariances, the {\em a priori} and {\em a posteriori} filtering densities. Heuristically, the estimator is a compromise between the one-step predictor and the filtered estimator of a discrete-time Kalman filter. When the observation noise covariance is unknown, a generalization of the so-called unknown level problem, then a Wishart prior is assigned to the innovations covariance and an integral representation is obtained for the desired likelihood ratio. The representation suggests a parallel structure for approximating the likelihood ratio when the observation noise covariance is unknown. Finally, the likelihood ratio for detecting finite-state Markov sequences is derived to illustrate that in general no ""pure"" estimator-correlator structure can exist when the state-space is finite.","['Louis L.

"The motivation for seeking hardware solutions to database management functions traditionally carried out by software has been apparent to data-base designers for sometime now. Firstly, database management software has grown in complexity and size over the years. This growth is prompted by the increase in user requirements, by the formulation of sophisticated models and by the change in data processing mode from an off-line, batched, single user environment to an on-line, concurrent and multi-user environment. Large and complex software systems tend to be failure-prone. Further-more, practical verification methods for software systems are still not in sight. On the other hand, methods for verifying hardware functionality, design and production have long been available. Advanced technology has also overcome some of the problems of the logic complexity and capacity requirements, making the construction of relatively large and complex computers viable. By incorporating basic database management functions into hardware, not only can we provide more reliable basic functions, but we can also improve the software reliability since the software requirements will be less complex and the system software will be smaller in size.","['David K.

"Abstract#R##N##R##N#Adaptable programs are one of the benefits of structured programming. The adaptability of a program is the degree to which it can be transformed into another program that performs a similar, but slightly different, function. While it is clear that the aims of structured programming are best satisfied by the use of modern programming languages, a great number of programmers must use languages such as Fortran. To alleviate this situation, a number of preprocessors have been introduced that give Fortran a more structured facade. This paper describes an experiment performed to test the adaptability of programs written in RATFOR, one of these preprocessors. Judging from the results, the use of a good preprocessor can significantly increase the adaptability of Fortran programs.",['David R.

The first method is a recurrent one with respect to k and is well adapted for machine computation, but does not itself provide a proof that it can be continued indefinitely.

"“Next-fit” allocation differs from first-fit in that a first-fit allocator commences its search for free space at a fixed end of memory, whereas a next-fit allocator commences its search wherever it previously stopped searching. This strategy is called “modified first-fit” by Shore [2] and is significantly faster than the first-fit allocator. To evaluate the relative efficiency of next-fit (as well as to confirm Shore's results) a simulation was written in Basic Plus on the PDP-11, using doubly linked lists to emulate the memory structure of the simulated computer. The simulation was designed to perform essentially in the manner described in [2]. The results of the simulation of the three methods show that the efficiency of next-fit is decidedly inferior to first-fit and best-fit when the mean size of the block requested is less than about 1/16 the total memory available. Beyond this point all three allocation schemes have similar efficiencies.",['Carter Bays'],39,['e4499379-fad3-443f-b1e7-61643835c1f5'],"A comparison of next-fit, first-fit, and best-fit",Communications of The ACM,1977,cde170a1-e03c-4551-a04f-aa5eed50439a

In this paper a controller is developed for a synchronous machine using a hierarchical approach to model following. A linear model is defined which incorporates the desired response characteristics for the non-linear machine and the controller attempts to reduce the error between the system and model states while not utilising excessive control effort. This latter problem is solved by decomposition using an off-line two level structure where on level one two one point boundary value problems are solved whereas on level 2 a prediction algorithm is used. Simulation results show that the algorithm converages rapidly giving a control which reduces the error satisfactorily. The control calculation is very efficient in computer storage and takes less than half the computation time of the global optimal control calculation.,"['Mohamed F. Hassan', 'Madan G.

"GPGS is a subroutine package offering powerful and versatile support for passive and interactive vector graphics, for time-sharing, batch, and stand-alone minicomputer systems. The package is computer, language, and operating system, as well as display device independent. Its key purpose is to allow for transportabiliit of programs and programmers by providing easy to learn, high level features. The applications programmer writes his program once and then executes it on any supported graphics equipment without recompiling or relinking it. Device-independence was implemented by dividing GPGS into a device-independent part invoked by the applications programmer, and internal, ""device drivers"", one per display device. Like the GSPC ""Core System"" whose design it influenced, GPGS is a general purpose package. It has a subset of graphics facilities to handle output of line and character primitives with attributes such as line style and character size, and input from interaction tools such as lightpens, keyboards, valuators, and function keys. It also supports 2D and 3D viewin transformationss for clipping and window to viewport mapping, and coordinate transformations.Unlike the GSPC Core System, GPGS also includes a set of basic features for modelling objects which allows definition of device independent masters called seudo picture segment. These are distinguished from normal, device (DPU) dependent pictur segments into which primitives and their attribute-value settings are ordinarily compiled. These masters may be instanced subject to affine transformations (translate, rotate, and scale) to create a typical master-instance hierarchy. The hierarchy may be stored in a disk based library or compiled into a normal picture segment for output to a display device.The images of objects stored in device dependent picture segments may be transformed on the display surface by v port (image) transformations. These typically allow use of hardware transformation capabilities for dragging or tumbling object images.Host/satellite graphics is accommodated by having the device independent part of GPGS in the host and splitting the device drivers across host and satellite. At the source code level it therefore makes no difference on which.configuration a program will be executed.Among the existing implementations are versions written in assembler for the IB 360/370 and the PDP 11, in both stand-alone and satellite mode, and under a variety of operating systems. They support plotters, storage tubes, and high performance refresh displays. FORTRAN based implementations exist for the Univac 1108, the PDP 10, and a Harris minicomputer.","['L. C.

"Some scientific inference tasks (including mass spectrum identification DerzdrczL, medical diagnosis  Mycin , and math theory development  AM ) have been successfully modelled as rule-directed search processes.

The limitations of AM suggest even more radical departures from traditional rule system architecture. All these modifications are then collected into a new, complicated set of constraints on the form of the data structures, the rules, the interpreter, and the distribution of knowledge between rules and data structures. These new policies sacrifice uniformity in the interests of clarity, efficiency and power derivable from a thorough characterization of the task.

"A high-level ""access path"" approach to database restructuring is described and contrasted with the ""elementary operations"" approach taken by most restructuring systems. With the elementary operations approach, restructuring is viewed as a sequence of basic or ""primitive"" operations which manipulate a source database in order to convert it into a target database. In the access path approach, restructuring is seen as the process of accessing a body of information represented by the source data, and constructing the target database representation of the same information. While the elementary operations approach is useful for restructuring hierarchical databases, it does not generalize well for networks. The access path approach is better-suited to the complex structures possible in network databases.   The access path approach permits the specification of complex restructuring transformations in terms of application-oriented concepts such as access strategies and selection criteria.

"We investigate the inference rules that can be applied to functional and multivalued dependencies that exist in a database relation. Three types of rules are discussed. First, we list the well known rules for functional dependencies. Then we investigate the rules for multivalued dependencies. It is shown that for each rule for functional dependencies the same rule or a similar rule holds for multivalued dependencies. There is, however, one additional rule for multivalued dependencies that has no parallel among the rules for functional dependencies. Finally, we present rules that involve functional and multivalued dependencies together. The main result of the paper is that the rules presented are complete for the family of functional and multivalued dependencies.","['Catriel Beeri', 'Ronald Fagin', 'John H.

"Two classes of probability densities, the exponential Fourier densities and the exponential trigonometric densities, are introduced on the unit sphere, as well as four kinds of displacements. In general, neither class is closed under the operation of taking conditional distributions with respect to any of the displacements. A combined usage of both classes is required to study the estimation and detection models obtained from various combinations of the displacements. The merits and disadvantages of each model are discussed. Recursive formulas for the conditional densities and the likelihood ratios are derived for many of the models. The additive measurement noise case is also considered in detail. An error criterion for direction estimation is presented with respect to which the optimal estimates can be easily computed from the probability distribution.

"CLU is a new programming language designed to support the use of abstractions in program construction. Work in programming methodology has led to the realization that three kinds of abstractions, procedural, control, and especially data abstractions, are useful in the programming process. Of these, only the procedural abstraction is supported well by conventional languages, through the procedure or subroutine. CLU provides, in addition to procedures, novel linguistic mechanisms that support the use of data and control abstractions. This paper provides an introduction to the abstraction mechanisms in CLU. By means of programming examples, we illustrate the utility of the three kinds of abstractions in program construction and show how CLU programs may be written to use and implement abstractions.

"The problem of optimal dynamic transition of a firm with market power from a predetermined initial condition to a known statically optimal equilibrium state is formulated. The model of the firm is linear, discrete time, and behavioristic in nature with production, demand, inventory, and order and sales sectors. Prices and changes in the production rate constitute the decision variables which are assumed to be bounded. The optimal control sequence subject to bounded control efforts is derived to minimize a quadratic performance index by invoking the maximum principle. It consists of maximum effort transitions followed by a series of singular steps which ultimately drive the system to the equilibrium state. Existence and optimality of the solution are proved.

This paper gives an  input independent  average linear time algorithm for storage and retrieval on keys. The algorithm makes a random choice of hash function from a suitable class of hash functions. Given any sequence of inputs the expected time (averaging over all functions in the class) to store and retrieve elements is linear in the length of the sequence. The number of references to the data base required by the algorithm for any input is extremely close to the theoretical minimum for any possible hash function with randomly distributed inputs. We present three suitable classes of hash functions which also may be evaluated rapidly.

A VLWS is regarded as a vector-valued stochastic process in which the sequence of vector dimensions is itself a stochastic process. For a given VLWS, the symbol sequence is not uniquely defined because it depends on how the choice of the time origin is made. In particular, a deterministic choice leads to a nonstationary symbol sequence even if the originating VLWS is stationary.

Several of these authors note that such transformation systems could be used to transform lucid, high-level, but possibly inefficient program descriptions into efficient but possibly less legible underlying concrete realizations. One problem, mentioned by Loveman [Loveman] is that of chaining together many low-level simple transformations to achieve high-level goals. For example, we may wish to chain together low-level transformations such as constant propagation, performing arithmetic at transformation time, dead variable elimination, empty statement removal and the like, to achieve the high-level goal of program simplification.

"This paper is concerned with the determination of tight lower and upper bounds on the expectation of a convex function of a random variable. The classic bounds are those of Jensen and Edmundson-Madansky and were recently generalized by Ben-Tal and Hochman. This paper indicates how still sharper bounds may be generated based on the simple idea of sequentially applying the classic bounds to smaller and smaller subintervals of the range of the random variable. The bounds are applicable in the multivariate case if the random variables are independent.

"The effect of two important computer design parameters on floating point multiplication is studied. The parameters are the number of guard digits, and the decision whether the post-arithmetic normalization shift is done before or after rounding. Our results on the accurary of floating point multiplication depend on a stochastic model for computer numbers. There is an interesting interplay between guard digit possibilities and the normalization option. For example, our own first impression was that normalization before rounding would always be preferable to normalization after rounding. Our results show that this is not the case when there is only one guard digit. In a related vein, our results also give comprehensive justification of the following observation: On an even base machine whose architecture provides for normalization before rounding, one should not merely ask for symmetric rounding (rather than rounding by chopping). Instead one should ask for symmetric roundingplus two guard digits.","['Richard Goodman', 'Alan Feldstein']",50,"['14dec562-3456-4417-bda1-416f543573ae', 'aeaa852c-6555-4823-8da2-5c6991046beb', 'c33722a7-ba52-4048-a162-2ec2193093df', 'fbafb2d5-5e7f-414b-8abf-208f54d2538f']",Effect of guard digits and normalization options on floating point multiplication,Computing,1977,00072075-b850-42c8-97dc-5ebe191819c6

The set-covering problem is to minimize cx subject to Ax â§ en over all binary n-vectors x. A is an m × n binary matrix and en is an n-vector of 1's. We develop a new implicit enumeration strategy to solve this problem. The branching strategy is similar to the row partitioning strategy used by other authors in the partitioning problem. Simple and sharp bounds are obtained by relaxing the constraints of the associated linear program by attaching nonnegative multipliers to them. Good multipliers are obtained by using the subgradient optimization technique. Computational experience shows that these bounds are at least one order of magnitude more efficient than the ones obtained by solving the associated linear program with the simplex method. Computational results with this new implicit enumeration algorithm are encouraging.

"Most languages intended for artificial intelligence applications include a search and backtracking facility. While built-in backtracking facilities are convenient, they are often too inflexible for use beyond a limited range of applicability. Other mechanisms, such as those based on explicit manipulations of bindings or stack frames, tend to be very unstructured, and give the programmer little control over the backtracking process. This paper describes the SL5 programming language and its use for “programmable backtracking.” SL5 includes a general procedure mechanism that permits procedures to be used as recursive functions or as coroutines. Using this mechanism, the programmer can construct control hierarchies that are tailored to the specific application. A string pattern-matching facility is given as an example of the use of the SL5 facilities.","['Ralph E. Griswold', 'David R.

"Optimum estimates of nonobservable random variables or random processes which influence the rate functions of a discrete time jump process (D) are derived. The approach used is based on the {\em a posteriori} probability of a nonobservable event expressed in terms of the {\em a priori} probability of that event and of the sample function probability of the DTJP. Thus a general representation is obtained for optimum estimates, and recursive equations are derived for minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimates. In general, MMSE estimates are nonlinear functions of the observations. The problem of estimating the rate of a DTJP when the rate is a random variable with a beta probability density function and the jump amplitudes are binomially distributed is considered. It is shown that the MMSE estimates ale linear. The class of beta density functions is rather rich and explains why there are insignificant differences between optimum unconstrained and linear MMSE estimates in a variety of problems.","['Marco V.

"This paper extends past studies of advertising based on goodwill to include the probabilistic effects of advertising and forgetting. A stochastic advertising model for a monopoly firm is constructed and resolved for specific forms of feedback advertising policy. Further, a diffusion-approximation model is also suggested. Using these models, we derive optimum advertising policies of the open-loop and feedback type. The essential implications of the paper are: i advertising is a ""risky investment"" in goodwill, substituting current certain expenditures for uncertain profits; ii risk-averse firms will advertise less and risk-taking firms more; iii large risk-aversion and forgetting rates both lead to the standard competitive result in advertising.",['Charles S.

"High density packaging is one of the most urgent requirements in the design of digital systems. In the assembly of such systems,  printed wiring boards  (PWB's) are used very often to provide the necessary interconnection among circuit modules. Thus, methods to raise wiring density of PWB's are continually under investigation.   Given a router to realize 100 percent wiring, an efficient method for assigning logical gates to circuit modules and for determining the placement of the modules on a given PWB may contribute more toward raising the wirability than improving the existing routing scheme, especially when all available sophisticated routing algorithms have been attempted.   The present paper proposes an algorithm to the problem of gate assignment and module placement, to be added to an existing router. It operates on a PDP 11/40 with 24K words core memory and 1.2M words disk storage coupled with a TEKTRONIX 4014 graphics terminal.

"We prove that a countable complete theory whose prime model has an infinite definable subset, all of whose elements are named, has at least four countable models up to isomorphism. The motivation for this is the conjecture that a countable theory with a minimal model has infinitely many countable models. In this connection we first prove that a minimal prime model A has an expansion by a finite number of constants A' such that the set of algebraic elements of A' contains an infinite definable subset. We note that our main conjecture strengthens the Baldwin-Lachlan theorem. We also note that due to Vaught's result that a countable theory cannot have exactly two countable models, the weakest possible nontrivial result for a non-80-categorical theory is that it has at least four countable models. ?1. Notation and preliminaries. Our notation follows Chang and Keisler [1], except that we denote models by A, B, etc. We use the same symbol to refer to the universe of a model. Models we refer to are always in a countable language. For T a countable complete theory we let n(T) be the number of countable models of T up to isomorphism. 3"" means 'there are exactly n'. If Sp (x) is a formula and A is a structure in the appropriate language, then we define p A = {a E A: A l= Sp (a)}. If A is a model for the language L we define cl(A) = {a E A: there is formula p(x) in L such that A l= p(a) A 3""xp(x), for some n < c}. We say that a model A is minimal if it has no proper elementary substructure. A model A is atomic if every n-tuple realises a principal n-type of Th(A). By Vaught [2] a countable model A is atomic if and only if A is a prime model of Th(A). Also, any two elementarily equivalent countable atomic models are isomorphic. We make use of the Omitting Types Theorem which states that for any countable theory T and countable set of nonprincipal types of T, T has a model omitting those types. ?2. The main results.

Then A has an expansion A' by adding finitely many names such that in L (A') there is 'p (x) such that A'iS infinite and p A'C cl(A').",['Anand Pillay'],10,"['73f62763-5078-4fde-97da-ad1fec48c53f', 'c6d6c835-d885-481a-92e5-db8d5431fca2']",NUMBER OF COUNTABLE MODELS,Journal of Symbolic Logic,1978,f07ae1e5-1084-48b5-a6a8-f26fa2581457

"The principal transportation system in a highrise building is the elevator system. The performance of the system as perceived by the passengers can be measured by the time spent waiting for a car and smoothness of the ride. In turn, the waiting time is a very complex function of many variables: number of cars, car speed, number of floors served, passenger traffic, elevator dispatching strategy, etc. This paper discusses a recently developed minicomputer simulator, ELSIM, which simulates passenger traffic and the service rendered by a bank of elevators. This simulator uses a realistic mathematical model for passenger traffic within real-time minicomputer software and a display panel to produce a valuable tool for evaluating new elevator installations and modifications to existing systems.","['George T.

"For finite graphs F and G, let NF(G) denote the number of occurrences of F in G, i.e., the number of subgraphs of G which are isomorphic to F. If F and G are families of graphs, it is natural to ask then whether or not the quantities NF(G), F∈F, are linearly independent when G is restricted to G. For example, if F = {K1, K2} (where Kn denotes the complete graph on n vertices) and F is the family of all (finite) trees, then of course NK1(T) − NK2(T) = 1 for all T∈F. Slightly less trivially, if F = {Sn: n = 1, 2, 3,…} (where Sn denotes the star on n edges) and G again is the family of all trees, then Σn=1∞(−1)n+1NSn(T)=1 for all T∈G. It is proved that such a linear dependence can never occur if F is finite, no F∈F has an isolated point, and G contains all trees. This result has important applications in recent work of L.

Although these systems can exhibit impressive expert-like behavior, we believe that none of them is yet capable of truly expert reasoning.

"A proposal is made for the definition of 'tools', high-level graphics input functions based on the six primitive input classes Clock, Pick, Button, Key, Valuator and Locator.   Tools are defined in terms of input expressions, the operands of which are themselves tools, the definition of which may be nested inside this tool. Input expressions are written much like production rules in phrase structure grammars. Determining whether a tool is 'satisfied' can therefore be done most advantageously by an input expression parser.   Tool definitions may occur in-line or stored in a library. They are activated by a 'create' primitive, which creates an instance of the tool and causes the input expression to be made active. The parser then determines whether a tool is actually used. Following a 'read' issued to the tool, the tool body generates the returned information as specified by the tool definition. Tools may be explicitly freed by a 'free' primitive; in the case of nesting, tools are freed implicitly when the surrounding tool is freed.   Using this approach to higher-level input primitives, a programmer does not have to think about graphics input in terms of awaiting events, interrupts and the like.

A probabilistic vector model was developed to identify phonemically equivalent intervocalic stop consonants independently of the succeeding vowel's identity or the differences among talkers. Acoustic features of stop perception and production were studied as random processes whose probability density functions provided models for describing either the voicing mode or place-of-articulation of a stop. Each acoustic feature present in a stop's production contributed a vector whose magnitude and direction were determined from these acoustically based feature models. Combining these vectors resulted in the stop's identification. The voicing mode model performed as well as trained listeners (greater than 99% correct recognition) while the place-of-articulation model performed 15% below the level of trained listeners.,['Thomas J.

"Abstract#R##N#Methyl and methylene protons of dihydrouridine 17 (hU), 6-methyladenosine 37 (M6A), 7-methylguanosine 46 (m7G), and ribothymidine 54 (rT) give clearly resolved peaks (220 MHz) for tRNA1val (coli solutions in D2O, 0.25 m NaCl, at 27 degrees C. Chemical shifts are generally consistent with a solution structure of tRNA1val similar to the crystal structure of tRNAphe (yeast). At least 3 separate transitions are observed as the temperature is raised. The earliest involves disruption of native tertiary structure and formation of intermediate structures in the m7G and rT regions. A second transition results in a change in structure of the anticodon loop, containing m6A. The final step involves unfolding of the m7G and rT intermediates and melting of the TpsiC helix. Low salt concentrations produce multiple, partially denatured conformations, rather than a unique form, for tRNA1val. Native structure is almost completely reformed by addition of Na+ but Mg2+ is required for correct conformation in the vicinity of m7G.","['Rodney V. Kastrup', 'Paul G.

"This paper presents an analysis of time-sharing computer facilities using scheduling algorithms defined in terms of priority functions. We consider the class of algorithms in which a job's priority is defined by the difference between the time it spent in the system and an arbitrary function F of its attained service, where F is called the policy function. Our main result, the average response time for a job conditioned on its service requirement, applies to a broad class of policy functions. The derivation is based on the model of a processor-sharing M/G/1 queuing system and does not use transforms. The analysis is simplified by the decomposition of a non-Markovian process. Properties of the average response time resulting from policy function schedulers are discussed and related to those of other known time-sharing scheduling algorithms. For the examples of linear, exponential, and composite policy functions we plot the response times. We demonstrate the flexibility and the limitations of policy functions with respect to the discriminatory treatment of short jobs versus long ones and discuss the optimal selection of a policy function with respect to a given overall performance criterion.",['Manfred Ruschitzka'],50,"['8e0da402-4528-4b27-ab1b-1f668e7f02f6', '94fd7d1a-14ce-4218-ac80-7c5661297329', 'c9bd364c-09e7-434d-b6bb-0053f1f8f982']",An Analytical Treatment of Policy Function Schedulers,Operations Research,1978,ca9ff1ef-05a3-4bcf-b9f6-794f87903985

"The problem of deciding whether a given propositional formula in conjunctive normal form is satisfiable has been widely studied. I t is known that, when restricted to formulas having only two literals per clause, this problem has an efficient (polynomial-time) solution. But the same problem on formulas having three literals per clause is NP-complete, and hence probably does not have any efficient solution.   In this paper, we consider an infinite class of satisfiability problems which contains these two particular problems as special cases, and show that every member of this class is either polynomial-time decidable or NP-complete. The infinite collection of new NP-complete problems so obtained may prove very useful in finding other new NP-complete problems. The classification of the polynomial-time decidable cases yields new problems that are complete in polynomial time and in nondeterministic log space.

"Given a set of points in a d-dimensional space, an orthogonal range query is a request for the number of points in a specified d-dimensional box. We present a data structure and algorithm which enable one to insert and delete points and to perform orthogonal range queries. The worstcase time complexity for n operations is O(n logd n); the space usea is O(n logd-1 n). (O-notation here is with respect to n; the constant is allowed to depend on d.) Next we briefly discuss decision tree bounds on the complexity of orthogonal range queries. We show that a decision tree of height O(dn log n) (Where the implied constant does not depend on d or n) can be constructed to process n operations in d dimensions. This suggests that the standard decision tree model will not provide a useful method for investigating the complexity of such problems.",['George S.

This optimization problem is here shown to be equivalent to the problem of covering the edges of a graph by complete subgraphs with the objective of minimizing the number of complete subgraphs. A relationship between this edge-clique-cover problem and the graph coloring problem is established which allows algorithms for either one of these problems to be constructed from algorithms for the other. As consequences of this relationship, the keyword conflict problem and the edge-clique-cover problem are shown to be NP-complete, and if  P  ≠  NP  then they do not admit polynomial-time approximation algorithms which always produce solutions within a factor less than 2 from the optimum.","['Lawrence T.

"We formulate a continuous-time, infinite-horizon, discounted-cost cash management model with both fixed and proportional transactions costs and with linear holding and penalty costs. We model the cumulative demand for cash by a Wiener process with drift and use the optimal control technique of ""impulse control"" to find sufficient conditions under which an optimal policy exists. We show that these conditions are always met. Therefore, we prove that there always exists an optimal policy for the cash management problem and that this policy is of a simple form. When the proportional transactions cost of decreasing the cash balance is sufficiently high, it is never optimal to decrease the cash balance. Then the cash management model degenerates to the inventory model. We prove that there always exists an optimal policy for the inventory model and that this policy is of a simple form. Under special cases of the cash management model we obtain analytic expressions for the parameters of the optimal policy.","['Constantinides G', 'Scott F.

"An effective numerical computation of the steady-state Riccati matrix is based on the successive solutions of a Lyapunov equation using Newton's method. The requirements of this algorithm are an initial stabilizing matrix and the numerical solution of the associated Lyapunov equation. Computationally, the first requirement is the more influencing factor in solving the Riccati equation with reasonable accuracy and speed. In this paper an initial matrix, based on the parameter imbedded solution of the Riccati equation, is introduced for the Newton's algorithm. The imbedding Newton algorithm has been applied to a variety of system, both stable and unstable as well as high-dimensional, A matrices, one of which is reported here.

"A clustering scheme using a multidimensional histogram stored in a table is described and tested on four-dimensional data derived from LANDSAT imagery. By doing all clustering operations on the histogram rather than on the original measurement vectors, it is possible to reduce the computations by a large factor and handle the large sample sizes that are typically encountered in image processing. The clustering algorithm first isolates and delineates the peaks in the multidimensional histogram. These peaks are then used as cluster centers, and all the other measurement vectors in the histogram are assigned to the nearest center. The scheme initially identifies the most separable clusters in the data. It then runs on an interactive basis allowing the user to split specific clusters into subclusters at the expense of less separability. The histogram approach lends itself to statistical analysis using parametric models and the likelihood ratio test. As a starting point, it is assumed that the observed distribution is a mixture of several multivariate Gaussian distributions with unknown mean vectors, covariance matrices, and a priori probabilities. Estimates of the Gaussian parameters are determined ignoring the overlap of the neighboring distributions. The theoretical histogram is then calculated by integrating numerically the probability density function in each of the cells of the histogram, and the likelihood ratio test is applied to measure the departure of the model from the observed data. A statistical measure taking into account the number of degrees of freedom is defined and used to choose between alternative models.","['Morris Goldberg', 'Seymour Shlien']",12,"['126446a1-730e-44dc-858b-e5c768bd81ac', '4b0e2ca5-4d95-43cb-b18f-1bf9fd64bacf', 'e5f5cacc-f6da-458e-b8cb-bcfbd753e611']",A Clustering Scheme for Multispectral Images,systems man and cybernetics,1978,61439586-2c8e-46d6-83d6-2d3ad3e20433

"Lowering the cost of graphic display units for use in personnal computers and as time-sharing consoles suggests the use of TV sets. Display electronics for such a raster-scan unit will include a screen memory containing the state of all displayable points, that is up to 256 Kbits for 512 × 512 B&W display and more for colour applications. Technological advances in NMOS memories make such memory sizes cheaper and cheaper. The control part ensuring screen refresh, memory management, vector and character generation, and computer coupling remains very complex. A microprocessor-oriented Large-Scale-Integrated circuit including all these functions has been designed at the Ecole Normale Superieure.   Versatility has guided the design, as well for screen memory organization as for microprocessor interface. Display resolution from 64 × 64 to 512 × 512 are possible, with any number of colours or grey levels, depending only upon the memory size. Microprocessor interface is standard: an eight bits bidirectionnal data bus, a four bits address bus, a read-write signal and an interrupt request. These signals control the vector and character generators which execute microprocessor's commands during the idle phasis of the display controller. This permits an always clean diplay and yet a decent average speed of one point every 1.3 μs.   In addition, a light-pen or crosshair circuitry allows interactive graphic use.",['Philippe Matherat'],1,[],A chip for low-cost raster-scan graphic display,international conference on computer graphics and interactive techniques,1978,ec6696ff-e5a5-43b1-8ada-435196463f95

"Computer security has been an important issue since the first computer was developed. However, with the advent of faster and more accessible machines used by many users and large quantities of shared data, this issue has achieved far greater importance. It is no longer sufficient to rely on a system of password control through which a user is protected by having a 7-letter code known only to himself, since while this may, in the best case, prevent other users from directly accessing the users area, it does little to prevent indirect access. The potential dangers from such indirect access increase manyfold. In this survey, we shall discuss protection in three forms. The first is the privacy-certification problem for digital information. To maintain the privacy and authenticity of information cryptosystems and digitalized ""signature"" algorithms have been devised. The second involves the problems of unauthorized users gaining access to restricted data. In this case, it is necessary to discuss access control mechanisms that can be brought to bear in order to protect each users security. A third and far more subtle method of compromising a system is through what is called ""statistical inference"". Here, the user obtains information that is available to him legally and uses this information to infer information to which he has no access privileges. As more secure access-control mechanisms are proposed to guard from illegal access to protected data, it is this problem which looms as the major important problem of data security. And, this problem can never be totally solved since we must grant to authorized users access to data of this type. As an illustration of this problem, consider a problem faced by the census bureau ( or any other creator of administrative databases). In such a database, sensitive information is collected about a group of individuals while guaranteeing each individual that data collected about him will not be made available to users at large. However, in order to do research on large segments of the population, it is necessary for aggregated forms of this data to be made available to certain users. Suppose that a sociologist wishes to study correlations among a population with respect to various characteristics. Then, it might be necessary to give this sociologist access to the data. However, in order to guarantee each individual's privacy, we will wish to do this in a statistical manner. That is, we will refuse to answer questions about an individual or small set of individuals, but will make available information about larger segments of society in a manner that does not give information about any individual. And the problem arises as to how to insure that no malicious user can use this information in order to determine the characteristics of a single individual. A common method that has been proposed is to refuse access to information about any set of individuals which consists of too few people and in this manner restrict access to individual data. When data is given about a set of individuals, it will then be given in an aggregated form consisting of mean or median characteristics or counts of the number of people having a certain characteristic. However, as shown below, such a limitation is often not sufficient to guarantee individual privacy. Furthermore, refusing to answer a question often gives as much information as an aggregated answer since one might be able to infer information from the reason for a non-answer. Another area where this problem is of great significance is in the problem of medical record-keeping. Here, we may wish to track a set of people having a certain ailment in their early life (or people who have been exposed to certain phenomena) in order to determine long range effects of medications or exposures. In so doing, we want to make the data as helpful as possible to medical researchers while guaranteeing individual privacy. Because of the nature of such data, it is of great value to malicious users.","['Richard A. DeMillo', 'David P.

"Boolean extensions in which constructible cardinals are collapsed by ordinal definable sets. Let 9M be a transitive model of set theory with the axiom of choice. Definability of sets in the generic extensions of 9M is closely related to the automorphisms of the corresponding Boolean algebra. In particular, if G is an 9M-generic ultrafilter on a rigid complete Boolean algebra C, then every set in 9M[G] is definable from parameters in 9W. Hence if B is a complete Boolean algebra containing a set of forcing conditions to collapse some cardinals in 9M, it suffices to construct a rigid complete Boolean algebra C, in which B is completely embedded. If G is as above, then 9M[G] satisfies ""every set is 9)-definable"" and the inner model 9M[G n B] contains the collapsing mapping determined by B. To complete the result, it is necessary to give some conditions under which every cardinal from 9M[G n B] remains a cardinal in 9M[G].

"Given a finite set  E  of random variables, the entropy function  h  on  E  is a mapping from the set of all subsets of  E  into the set of all nonnegative real numbers such that for each  A ⊆ E h(A)  is the entropy of  A .

"The results of a time domain segmentation algorithm are applied to a variable frame rate (VFR) transmission system. Three speech signal parameters (short-term absolute average of the speech signal, absolute average of the differenced signal, and the ratio of these two) are measured pitch-synchronously and interpolated to short frames of 5 to 10 ms duration. From these frames, a distance measure is evaluated leading towards a ""segment length function"" which indicates the time distance from a given frame to exceed a parameter change threshold. This function is directly converted into a local interval sequence for the frames of a speech transmission system.

They posed the problem of finding a natural structural correspondence which explains this coincidence. In the present paper this problem is answered by constructing two-to-one correspondences from certain sets of binary sequences to each of the sets of trees concerned, giving a structural basis for the equation 2an = 2pn. Answers are also supplied to similar correspondence-type problems of Harary and Robinson, concerning planted plane trees, and achiral rooted plane trees. In addition, each of these four types of plane trees are counted with numbers of points and endpoints as the enumeration parameters. The results all show a symmetry with respect to the number of endpoints which is not shared by the set of all plane trees.",['Nicholas C.

"The aims of this paper are twofold. Firstly, it aims to describe progress towards the development of a performance modelling technique which is appropriate to problems involving communicating parallel activities. Secondly, in doing this, it aims to provide an example of how differing areas of research may be related to their mutual benefit, and to indicate how facets of them may be combined to provide a valuable design tool. We draw on two current areas of research: a method of expression of concurrent activities in a programming language called EPL; and analytical performance modelling techniques based on probabilistic grammars, finite state machines and computation structures. These two areas are brought together by re-casting salient features in Petri net form. Only a sub-class of Petri nets is needed, giving valuable properties which are exploited in determining the extent to which current analytical techniques can be used.

"A real-time list processing system is one in which the time required by the elementary list operations (e.g. CONS, CAR, CDR, RPLACA, RPLACD, EQ, and ATOM in LISP) is bounded by a (small) constant. Classical implementations of list processing systems lack this property because allocating a list cell from the heap may cause a garbage collection, which process requires time proportional to the heap size to finish. A real-time list processing system is presented which continuously reclaims garbage, including directed cycles, while linearizing and compacting the accessible cells into contiguous locations to avoid fragmenting the free storage pool. The program is small and requires no time-sharing interrupts, making it suitable for microcode. Finally, the system requires the same average time, and not more than twice the space, of a classical implementation, and those space requirements can be reduced to approximately classical proportions by compact list representation. Arrays of different sizes, a program stack, and hash linking are simple extensions to our system, and reference counting is found to be inferior for many applications.",['Henry G.

"A framework for viewing human text comprehension, memory, and recall is presented that assumes patterns of abstract conceptual relations are used to guide processing. These patterns consist of clusters of knowledge that encode prototypical co-occurrences of situations and events in narrative texts. The patterns are assumed to be a part of a person's world knowledge and can be activated during comprehension to build associations among multiple linguistic propositions in memory according to their higher-order conceptual relations. During text reproduction from memory, these patterns provide retrieval plans for recall and a mechanism for sophisticated “guessing” when retrieval fails. Some data from human text learning tasks are presented as evidence for these higher-order conceptual patterns. Several structural and processing properties of the model are evaluated in light of these data. It is argued that the proposed pattern-directed processing model could be successfully implemented in artificial intelligence systems to provide adaptive error-handling mechanisms such as those observed in human behavior.",['Perry W.

The resulting optimum mapping is a linear combination of the projections of the posterior probabilities onto the subspace spanned by the \psi_{j}(X) . The problem of finding the best single feature and seqnential feature selection is discussed in this framework. Finally, several examples are discussed.","['Keinosuke Fukunaga', 'Robert D.

"A quantity called the {\em finite-state} complexity is assigned to every infinite sequence of elements drawn from a finite sot. This quantity characterizes the largest compression ratio that can be achieved in accurate transmission of the sequence by any finite-state encoder (and decoder). Coding theorems and converses are derived for an individual sequence without any probabilistic characterization, and universal data compression algorithms are introduced that are asymptotically optimal for all sequences over a given alphabet. The finite-state complexity of a sequence plays a role similar to that of entropy in classical information theory (which deals with probabilistic ensembles of sequences rather than an individual sequence). For a probabilistic source, the expectation of the finite state complexity of its sequences is equal to the source's entropy. The finite state complexity is of particular interest when the source statistics are unspecified.",['Jacob Ziv'],202,"['2891aa58-33a5-4159-84e0-9969f199facc', '6e1dba69-c43b-4fbe-b811-efda3f57b185', '79fcfcde-b441-4838-8548-42c988a774db', '970e6dc9-e1a7-4f77-b082-0ff58fe7f8cd', '9919f52a-81b9-4a91-b16c-deb58aab4f26', 'cfacea7d-76ee-4bdc-be44-411cf54bdd64', 'dd7887a4-2dfe-460b-aa32-1550bf115429']",Coding theorems for individual sequences,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,1978,89bf8622-82e3-4672-82c8-ef0b62245766

In this paper we discuss the use of a recursive nonlinear filter. The design of the proposed filter is accomplished in two stages. First, a constrained least-squares technique is employed to obtain, off-line, a filtered signal from a typical distorted signal. Then this pair of signals is used in a model identification scheme, to arrive at the nonlinear recursive filter. Since the final filter is recursive, and synthesized in one of the two alternative structures, both the memory and computation requirements are low enough to permit efficient on-line implementation.","['S.

"A new method of constructing a universal sequence of block codes for coding a class of ergodic sources is given. With this method, a weakly universal sequence of codes is constructed for variable-rate noise. less coding and for fixed- and variable-rate coding with respect to a fidelity criterion. In this way a unified approach to weak universal block source coding is obtained. For the noiseless variable-rate coding and the fixed-rate coding with respect to fidelity criterion, the assumptions made on the alphabets, distortion measures, and class of sources are both necessary and sufficient. For fixed-rate coding with respect to a fidelity criterion, the sample distortion of the universal code sequence converges in L^{l} norm for each source to the optimum distortion for that source. For both variable-rate noiseless coding and variable-rate coding with respect to a fidelity criterion, the sample rate of the universal code sequence converges in L^{1} norm for each source to the optimum rate for that source.

"This tutorial is extracted from the recently completed monograph, Computer Security: Its Problems and Solutions [3], and is intended as a technical review of research in the areas of operating system security. Furthermore, it is intended to provide some assessment and evaluation of the work reviewed. Some projections and speculations of future activities in operating system research are also included. Because the tutorial is written for technical people who are not directly conducting such research, we have tried to present the review in an illustrative manner with intuitive and informal definitions of the necessary technology. The tutorial expounds the notion of surveillance in terms of logging and threat monitoring. It conceptualizes the problems and solutions of access control. To achieve security, the operating system relies on isolation. The tutorial points out the trade-off between security and cost of isolation. Furthermore, it illustrates two impor tant isolation methods. In order to provide security, the operating system must be designed and implemented as a secure system. The use of verification techniques for proving the correctness of secure operating system design and implementation is examined. When the operating system is large and the security requirements are elaborate, it may be necessary to concentrate the secure elements in a kernel. The notion of secure kernel is therefore examined. Other methods such as penetration tests are also examined An up-to-date bibliography since 1974 is included. To allow the readers to have a coherent coverage of various topics of operating system security, we have endeavored to give our personal views of various subject matters. We would like the reader to bear with us in the expression of these views.","['David K. Hsiao', 'Douglas S. Kerr', 'Stuart E.

"Burke and Reich independently showed that the output of an M/M/1 queue in equilibrium is a Poisson process. Consequently, analysis of series (tandem) exponential servers with a Poisson input stream can be reduced to consideration of a series of M/M/1 queues. This work generalizes the above results to so-called Jackson networks, consisting of exponential servers with mutually independent Poisson exogenous inputs and random customer routings permitting customer feedback. We prove that traffic on all exit arcs of a network in equilibrium is Poisson; moreover, the customer streams leaving any exit set are mutually independent. Here an exit arc is a path from server node i such that a customer moving along the arc cannot return to i; an exit set V is a set of server nodes such that customers departing V can never re-enter V. As a special case, the traffic streams leaving a Jackson network in equilibrium are mutually independent Poisson processes. In contrast, traffic on non-exit arcs is non-Poisson, and indeed...","['Frederick J.

"Shadowing has historically been used to increase the intelligibility of scenes in electron microscopy and aerial survey. Various methods have been published for the determination of shadows in computer synthesized scenes. The display of shadows may make the shape and relative position of objects in such scenes more comprehensible; it is a technique lending vividness and realism to computer animation.   To date, algorithms for the determination of shadows have been restricted to scenes constructed of planar polygons. A simple algorithm is described which utilizes Z-buffer visible surface computation to display shadows cast by objects modelled of smooth surface patches. The method can be applied to all environments, in fact, for which visible surfaces can be computed. The cost of determining the shadows associated with each light source is roughly twice the cost of rendering the scene without shadows, plus a fixed transformation overhead which depends on the image resolution. No extra entities are added to the scene description in the shadowing process. This comprehensive algorithm, which permits curved shadows to be cast on curved surfaces, is contrasted with a less costly method for casting the shadows of the environment on a single ground plane.   In order to attain good results, the discrete nature of the visible-surface computations must be treated with care. The effects of dither, interpolation, and geometric quantization at different stages of the shadowing algorithm are examined. The special problems posed by self-shadowing surfaces are described.",['Lance Williams'],402,"['3bad05a2-cb72-45bd-bd59-5e7ae647c068', '4e631ef0-fad7-4dc0-901a-29af722c2169', 'f668f88e-d2c5-429e-9b2d-b35966fb0662', 'fce1228c-399a-4000-8074-619b80515b51']",Casting curved shadows on curved surfaces,international conference on computer graphics and interactive techniques,1978,92f35612-97cb-4967-9115-e80270bdd353

We present a formal type discipline for such polymorphic procedures in the context of a simple programming language, and a compile time type-checking algorithm w which enforces the discipline. A Semantic Soundness Theorem (based on a formal semantics for the language) states that well-type programs cannot “go wrong” and a Syntactic Soundness Theorem states that if fl accepts a program then it is well typed.

A method is described for making in situ measurements of the arrival angles of underwater explosion sounds. The cross-correlation versus time delay of signals from three or more pairs of hydrophones of varied spacings are measured. Each function contains maxima at delays controlled by the vertical and azimuthal angles and contaminating maxima related to the bubble pulse period and the spectral content of the signal. The contaminating maxima are reduced by converting the time delays to angles and averaging the correlations. Usable estimates of the vertical arrival angles are obtained when the azimuthal angles are known and vice versa.,['H. J.

"This paper presents a formal model using the context-free grammar (CFG) for the design and implementation of communication protocols. It is similar to the Backus-Naur Form that has been used to define the syntax of programming languages. The transmission grammar (TG) is used to define the protocol for the communication entities of a computer network. For the hierarchical protocol design, the communication entity of each level is decomposed into more detailed inner-layered components and/or logically independent parts. The local approach is first used to define the TG for each of the decomposed components and logical parts. The shuffle and substitution operations are then applied to integrate the TGs of the logical parts and the TGs of the components, respectively. Examples are given to illustrate the grammatical properties of protocols and the design methodologies of TGs.","['Albert Y. Teng', 'Ming T.

"The use of production systems as the primary method for encoding knowledge in large knowledge-based systems is discussed at two levels; their suitability as an architecture that can be efficiently supported and their appropriateness as a language of expression.

Factors governing efficiency are discussed informally, and the usefulness of production systems as an information processing abstraction is examined critically.

"The simple cash balance problem is to determine the timing, direction, and magnitude of transfers between a firm's earning asset e.g., bonds and cash balance. Recently, Blackburn and Eppen developed a forward algorithm and limited planning horizon results for a dynamic, deterministic, discrete-time version of this problem. They were able to obtain planning horizons only if an optimal plan for some subproblem included conversion of bonds to cash in the final period and a certain condition on demand was fulfilled. We derive much more general planning horizon results-the transaction is allowed to be conversion of cash to bonds, it need not be in the final period, and the special condition on demand need not be fulfilled. The methodology used is an extension of that developed by Lundin and Morton for the ordinary dynamic lot-size model.

"Abstract#R##N##R##N#Consider a directed, source-sink network whose arcs either function or fail with known probabilities. This paper presents a decomposition algorithm for the exact computation of the reliability of such a network; that is, the probability that there exists a path from the network's source to its sink, consisting only of functioning arcs. The decomposition algorithm, which can be used even after the network can undergo no further modular decomposition, is based on a partitioning of the nodes of the network into subsets that can be sequentially analyzed. The algorithm permits arbitrary dependence among arcs that terminate at nodes belonging to the same subset of the partition but requires two arcs terminating at nodes belonging to different subsets to be independent. Computational experience from a computer implementation of the algorithm is also reported.",['Andrew W.

Abstract#R##N##R##N#A matroidal family is a nonempty set ℱ of connected finite graphs such that for every arbitrary finite graph G the edge sets of the subgraphs of G which are isomorphic to an element of ℱ form a matroid on the edge set of G. In the present paper the question whether there are any matroidal families besides the four previously described by Simoes-Pereira is answered affirmatively. It is shown that for every natural number n ⩾ 2 there is a matroidal family that contains the complete graph with n vertices. For n = 4 this settles Simoes-Pereira's conjecture that there is a matroidal family containing all wheels.,['Thomas Andreae'],6,"['2b17b8aa-655b-4dd0-9a90-b3f38dad2505', '4818edd9-5a35-470b-a8bd-cd6ba3c31e71']",Matroidal families of finite connected nonhomeomorphic graphs exist,Journal of Graph Theory,1978,a3c6f0f6-62c7-41dc-8e05-5b96814c4d76

"We describe methods for achieving an acceptable level of fault-tolerance in a multiprocessor designed for the execution of critical flight tasks on commercial aircraft. The SIFT (Software Implemented Fault-tolerant) system differs from other reliable computer architectures in the manner of utilization of redundant resources. The SIFT system is designed to cope with hardware faults by detecting discrepancies in the results computed by separately executed versions of critical programs. When such a discrepancy occurs we identify the processor/memory unit, bus unit, or processor/bus interface that has failed. A reconfiguration of task execution among the available resources is carried out to avoid the use of hardware units that have been identified as faulty or unreliable. We explain how the identification of faulty units can be effected, how the system may be reconfigured to avoid use of faulty units, and show that these reconfiguration policies are ""safe"" with respect to faults that do not occur in separated units during the short interval required to carry out the reconfiguration of tasks.","['Charles B.

"An algorithm is presented for designing multi-band FIR digital filters to suppress wideband or bimodal clutter in MTI radars. The technique is an iterative process in which the passband edges are varied to maximize the usable bandwidth over which a signal is detected with acceptable probability while maintaining specified clutter rejection. The clutter-bandwidth tradeoff is shown to be a function of such interrelated filter parameters as number of taps, transition widths, passband ripple, variable stopband attenuation, and stopband width. A 25-tap bandstop filter design is presented which provides 70% usable bandwidth while maintaining 20 dB wideband clutter rejection. The design is then modified to include an additional 50 dB ground clutter attenuation. The resulting 26-tap multi-band filter meets all specifications while still retaining 60% usable bandwidth. An alternative technique for bimodal clutter rejection is presented which utilizes the natural null at dc for an N-even bandstop filter to attenuate the ground component.","['Brian P.

"A scheme for storing information in a memory system with defective memory ceils using ""additive"" codes was proposed by Kuznetsov and Tsybakov. When a source message is to be stored in a memory with defective cells, a code vector x masking the defect pattern of the memory is formed by adding a vector defined by the message and the defect pattern to the encoded message, and then x is stored. The decoding process does not require the defect information. Considerably better bounds on the information rate of codes of this type which are capable of masking multiple defects and correcting multiple temporary errors are presented. The difference between the upper and lower bounds approaches the difference between the known best upper and lower bounds for random error correcting linear codes as the word length becomes large. Examples of efficient codes for masking double or fewer defects and correcting multiple temporary errors are presented.","['A. V.

"The foundations of capability schemes are critically examined. The context free utilization of capabilities once acquired is shown to be inconsistent with both least privilege norm and information flow requirements. An enhanced Capability Vector mechanism which pre-confines the set of capabilities with which a given capability can be combined is proposed. It is shown that capability vectors dynamically define an information flow structure which is potentially more refined, flexible, and versatile than traditional information classification systems. Based on this property, a Generalized Capability Vector machine which enforces a controlled information flow policy is designed. The proposed machine supports programmable resources which are either statically or dynamically bound to an information class.","['Harry J.

"We study the M/G/m queue and obtain difference-differential equations for the equilibrium joint distribution of the number of customers present and of the remaining holding times for services in progress. A study of these equations leads to the proposal of a simple approximation for the queue length distribution. Approximate waiting time and busy period distributions easily follow. Simple expressions for the means of the variables in question are obtained. Some numerical results on the mean waiting time indicate that the proposed approximation is rather accurate. The technique presented in this paper can also be applied to variants of the M/G/m queue.

"A data structure for modelling engineering components and assemblies is described. It is shown how the same structure, slightly extended, can also be used to represent a single component defined as boolean combinations of more primitive shapes. This leads to a unified method of handling both the concise boolean description and the longer explicit description in terms of faces, edges and vertices. The technique permits close control of evaluation from boolean to explicit description, and facilitates saving of partly evaluated results and back tracking.   The data structure is built up and evaluation is controlled through a geometrical language embedded in Algol 68.

"The results are presented of the first phase of a research project on the application of spatial modeling techniques to the process of planning and executing the construction of a nuclear power plant. A computer modeling technique, based on sets of polyhedra and spatial operations, was developed and applied to modeling the components of a nuclear power plant. The objectives of the modeling are: to store and retrieve information about the various systems in the facility; to produce drawings of those systems from any angle in differing amounts of detail; to aid in the search for interference among the parts of the plant by identifying those elements that occupy the same space or are too close to each other; to calculate information such as surface area, length, and volume of selected elements of the plant; and to aid in finding the optimum construction sequence by simulated construction of selected areas of the plant. Computer techniques are described for inputting information by digitizing directly from engineering drawings, for editing the spatial model, for management of the spatial and non-spatial data, and for graphic output from the model. The software is implemented on the University's central time-sharing computer system and on a mini-computer system in the Architectural Research Laboratory.","['Harold J. Borkin', 'Jonn F.

"This paper describes an integrated procedure mechanism that permits procedures to be used as recursive functions or as coroutines. This integration is accomplished by treating procedures and their activation records (called environments) as data objects and by decomposing procedure invocation into three separate components at the source-language level. In addition, argument binding is under the control of the programmer, permitting the definition of various methods of argument transmission in the source language itself. The resulting procedure mechanism, which is part of the SL5 programming language, is well suited to goal-oriented problems and to other problems that are more readily programmed by using coroutines.

"Most of the literature dealing with overflow oscillations in fixed-point digital filters has considered the direct form realization exclusively. In direct forms the question of whether oscillations are possible depends on the location of the poles of the filter. We show that it is possible to eliminate overflow oscillations, regardless of pole locations, by considering more general realizations. A sufficient condition is given for a state variable realization (using two's complement arithmetic) of any order to be free of overflow oscillation. A simple characterization of this condition is given for second order filters. Among second order realizations which meet the condition are so-called normal realizations and structures which minimize roundoff noise.","['William L. Mills', 'Clifford T. Mullis', 'Richard A.

"Compressibility of individual sequences by the class of generalized finite-state information-lossless encoders is investigated. These encoders can operate in a variable-rate mode as well as a fixed-rate one, and they allow for any finite-state scheme of variable-length-to-variable-length coding. For every individual infinite sequence x a quantity \rho(x) is defined, called the compressibility of x , which is shown to be the asymptotically attainable lower bound on the compression ratio that can be achieved for x by any finite-state encoder. This is demonstrated by means of a constructive coding theorem and its converse that, apart from their asymptotic significance, also provide useful performance criteria for finite and practical data-compression tasks. The proposed concept of compressibility is also shown to play a role analogous to that of entropy in classical information theory where one deals with probabilistic ensembles of sequences rather than with individual sequences. While the definition of \rho(x) allows a different machine for each different sequence to be compressed, the constructive coding theorem leads to a universal algorithm that is asymptotically optimal for all sequences.","['Jacob Ziv', 'Abraham Lempel']",4012,"['2891aa58-33a5-4159-84e0-9969f199facc', '3a886d3f-9c4f-4874-93ee-1e4d4d448326', '881b6260-0080-482c-8eae-983a32a738dd', '89bf8622-82e3-4672-82c8-ef0b62245766', 'dd7887a4-2dfe-460b-aa32-1550bf115429']",Compression of individual sequences via variable-rate coding,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,1978,5b581c14-442b-45e5-8bb9-dcad654bb069

The database management system keeps track of a directed graph, emanating from the creator, of granted privileges. The nodes of the graph correspond to users, and the edges (each of which is labeled with a timestamp) correspond to grants. The edges are of two types, corresponding to whether or not the recipient of the grant has been given the option to make further grants of this privilege. Furthermore, for each pair  A, B  of nodes, there can be no more than one edge of each type from  A  to  B . We modify this approach by allowing graphs in which there can be multiple edges of each type from one node to another. We prove correctness (in a certain strong sense) for our modified authorization mechanism. Further, we show by example that under the original mechanism, the system might forbid some user from exercising or granting a privilege that he “should” be allowed to exercise or grant.",['Ronald Fagin'],131,"['139c75f1-9d5b-4eea-95ff-626592c188c2', '8adbc90d-5b3b-461f-9ef6-271e9618396f']",On an authorization mechanism,ACM Transactions on Database Systems,1978,85396629-8c73-4c14-9a03-0c45a0c0694d

"With the increasing complexity of current digital systems, many aspects have to be considered in the Logic design of these systems. Among them are the pin limitations, interconnections, power dissipation, testability, and fan-in, fan-out constraints.   Since MOS (metal oxide semiconductor) is playing a major role in large scale integration (LSI), the problem of synthesis of MOS switching networks with large number of variables is very important. The main advantage of MOS over other forms of integrated circuits is the possibility of obtaining higher chip logic density. Long propagation delay limits MOS to low speed applications, however, speed can be improved by using advanced types of MOS as VMOS, DMOS and HMOS.   An efficient algorithm for computer-aided synthesis of MOS combinational logic networks was presented in the 1977 Design Automation Conference. That algorithm considered some of the aspects need to be considered in the logic design process. These were pin limitations, interconnections, and testability. In this paper we present a new algorithm which incorporates, in addition to the aspects considered above, the fan-in, fan-out constraints.   Designing digital systems with fan-in, fan-out constraints is vital for achieving proper operation of these systems - specifically speed and noise margin.   A step-by-step description as well as a detailed synthesis example are given. Some of the steps of this algorithm were programmed in FORTRAN V on a SPERRY UNIVAC TM  1108 computer. The effects of this kind of design on the network performance and testability are discussed. Finally, some future research problems in this area are presented.",['Yacoub M.

"We report on the results of research to code speech at 16 kbps under the condition that the quality of the transmitted speech be equal to that of the original. Some of the original speech had been corrupted by noise and distortions typical of long distance telephone lines. The rigorous requirements of this work led to a new outlook on adaptive predictive coding. We have found that the pitch predictor is not useful on balance and should be eliminated, and that the residual should be quantized with no clipping and encoded using a variable-length code. A single coding scheme seems to be adequate for all speech and all conditions. In addition, the adaptive predictive coding system has been modified to include a noise spectral shaping filter that effectively eliminates the perception of background granular noise.","['Michael G.

"Distortion-rate theory is used to derive absolute performance bounds and encoding guidelines for direct fixed-rate minimum mean-square error data compression of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a stationary real or circularly complex sequence. Both real-part-imaginary-part and magnitude-phase-angle encoding are treated. General source coding theorems are proved in order to justify using the optimal test channel transition probability distribution for allocating the information rate among the DFT coefficients and for calculating arbitrary performance measures on actual optimal codes. This technique has yielded a theoretical measure of the relative importance of phase angle over the magnitude in magnitude-phase-angle data compression. The result is that the phase angle must be encoded with 0.954 nats, or 1.37 bits, more rate than the magnitude for rates exceeding 3.0 nats per complex element. This result and the optimal error bounds are compared to empirical results for efficient quantization schemes.","['William A. Pearlman', 'Robert M.

"The purpose of this paper is to discuss the concept of hardware/software trade-offs from the perspective of the hardware designer. Primarily, the paper will examine software oriented functions/goals/requirements and discuss considerations in determining the kind of hardware support which would be involved in implementing the particular concept. This orientation follows a long-standing tradition; i.e., traditionally what appears in hardware is a result of functions which migrated into software packages, as the overall user community recognized their usefulness, and eventually migrating into hardware/firmware as manufacturers realized the usefulness of the functions. There are three dimensions to usefulness; i.e., is the function well understood, broadly used, and is the function cost effective to implement in hardware. Examples of functions which migrate from software into hardware are: floating point arithmetic, indexing, and memory management systems (virtual memory). A classic example of a function (well understood and broadly used) which has not migrated into hardware is payroll accounting. Probably the most important point is that payroll accounting routines are very specialized and many different versions (some observers place the number around 50,000) exist so that there is little standardization.

"All of the existing nearest neighbor searching techniques divide the searching into two parts: A global searching and a local searching. In order to minimize the number of records to be examined, the global searching must be a very sophisticated one such that the initial local searching will be confined to a very small region. This kind of global searching is usually very time-comsuming. In this paper, we propose the use of hash coding to guide the global search. Given a record, we hash it to an address and the initial searching is to be started by searching records stored in that address. We believe that our method is efficient because hashing is easy to implement and fast to execute. In other words, if our method is used, the global searching time will be very short.","['Chao-Liang Shen', 'Richard C. T.

Conjugate gradient methods are iterative methods for finding the minimizer of a scalar function fx of a vector variable x which do not update an approximation to the inverse Hessian matrix. This paper examines the effects of inexact linear searches on the methods and shows how the traditional Fletcher-Reeves and Polak-Ribiere algorithm may be modified in a form discovered by Perry to a sequence which can be interpreted as a memorytess BFGS algorithm. This algorithm may then be scaled optimally in the sense of Oren and Spedicalo. This scaling can be combined with Beale restarts and Powell's restart criterion. Computational results will show that this new method substantially outperforms known conjugate gradient methods on a wide class of problems.,['David F.

Asymptotic behavior of the relative efficiency is studied for the detection of a constant signal in additive noise. With some regularity conditions imposed on the noise density, the asymptotic relative efficiency of the sequential probability ratio test with respect to the corresponding fixed sample size likelihood ratio test is a function of the size and the power. As the size a approaches zero and the power approaches unity, this asymptotic relative efficiency has a limiting value depending on the functional relationship of a and 1 - \beta as they approach zero.

"A process control system designer is required to have an understanding of multiple disciplines in order to develop an appropriate design. This inc ludes knowledge of the process to be controlled, the habits of the user, and the architecture of the available control instrumentation. When a pro grammable digital computer is used, it is necessary to define models to help evaluate design tradeoffs. One such model defines a three axis matrix relating to the processes, the computer operating systems and the computer languages. A concept of levels of language matched with the operating system and the processes can then be developed. An evaluation with this model indicates that the major inadequacies of process control languages result when the system designer must default to an incorrect language to resolve interactions. The requirements of the process control clearly indicate that the computer should be adapted to the user. Most formal languages compromise these requirements significantly by forcing the user, the process and the operating system to conform to the language.","['I.L. Shaw', 'W.A. Edblad', 'A.M.

"We examine what happens to the game of basketball when one of the principal rules is changed. When a team scores a basket, we assume this team receives the ball on the next possession, a rule we call “winners' out.” This is, of course, the opposite of the usual “losers' outs” rule, where the opposite team receives the next possession. The implications of this rule are studied in the game where the first team to score a certain number of points wins and also in the game where the team that is ahead at the buzzer wins.

"In this paper, we develop a new homomorphic deconvolution system that is useful when the signal to be deconvolved is a convolution of two components, one of which is a train of pulses and for the other we have some a priori information on its approximate number of poles and zeros. The system that we develop is essentially the same as the logarithmic homomorphic deconvolution system (LHDS) [1]-[3] except that the logarithmic and exponential operations are replaced with ( ) γ and ( ) 1/γ operations. By theoretical and/or empirical results, we illustrate that under appropriate conditions, the new system with the proper choice of γ can potentially yield a better result than the LHDS and that the results obtained by the new system with the value of γ close to 0 are essentially the same as those obtained by the LHDS.

Finally, a phonetic word verification technique is exercised on each syllable. Prestored acoustic properties characteristic of each phonetic segment of each keyword are compared against the incoming acoustic properties found at appropriate locations anchored within and around the syllables.

"The problems of designing and manufacturing systems made from integrated circuits have been changing rapidly as semiconductor technology has made greater circuit densities possible. Because of this rapid rate of change and the short time available for system design, it is essential to have reasonably accurate preliminary estimates of logic circuit counts, package sizes, and costs, as well as of design schedules. By preliminary, we mean prior to availability of circuit level system logic designs and/or prior to availability of partitioning, placement, and wiring aids to layout in a particular technology. The problem is complicated by the difference in difficulty between the predictability of wiring demand on packages with regular arrays of logic carriers and packages containing variably sized and shaped groups of logic circuits. Methods have been developed for preliminary estimation of wiring capacity in both these situations, and both methods and results will be discussed.",['William R.

"A stationary channel can have two kinds of memory--input memory and output memory. Recently, Gray and Ornstein introduced a condition on the decay of input memory called \bar{d} -continuity and established coding theorems for d-continuous channels. In this paper a condition for the decay of output memory is introduced which is called conditional almost block independence (CABI). It is believed that these two properties describe the character of many channels of interest. The principal result states that the \bar{d} -continuous CABI channels are precisely those which can be approximated in a very strong sense by a simple kind of finite memory channel, called a primitive channel, in which the source of randomness is memoryless and completely separated from the memory.","['David L.

"In 1948 W. R. Bennett used a companding model for nonuniform quantization and proposed the formula D \: = \: \frac{1}{12N^{2}} \: \int \: p(x) [ E(x) ]^{-2} \dx for the mean-square quantizing error where N is the number of levels, p (x) is the probability density of the input, and E \prime (x) is the slope of the compressor curve. The formula, an approximation based on the assumption that the number of levels is large and overload distortion is negligible, is a useful tool for analytical studies of quantization. This paper gives a heuristic argument generalizing Bennett's formula to block quantization where a vector of random variables is quantized. The approach is again based on the asymptotic situation where N , the number of quantized output vectors, is very large. Using the resulting heuristic formula, an optimization is performed leading to an expression for the minimum quantizing noise attainable for any block quantizer of a given block size k . The results are consistent with Zador's results and specialize to known results for the one- and two-dimensional cases and for the case of infinite block length (k \rightarrow \infty) . The same heuristic approach also gives an alternate derivation of a bound of Elias for multidimensional quantization. Our approach leads to a rigorous method for obtaining upper bounds on the minimum distortion for block quantizers. In particular, for k = 3 we give a tight upper bound that may in fact be exact. The idea of representing a block quantizer by a block ""compressor"" mapping followed with an optimal quantizer for uniformly distributed random vectors is also explored. It is not always possible to represent an optimal quantizer with this block companding model.",['Allen Gersho'],1237,"['cca1cdfe-36a7-4c11-82d4-bc391e6f0f0f', 'd1caec61-29ca-4724-8350-e230c03efaf1']",Asymptotically optimal block quantization,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,1979,9ba74674-2280-4b06-883e-a3b43d3c67ce

"This paper addresses a problem that may arise in classification tasks: the design of procedures for matching an instance with a set of criteria for class membership in such a way as to permit the intelligent handling of inexact, as well as exact matches. An inexact match is a comparison between an instance and a set of criteria (or a second instance) which has the result that some, but not all, of the criteria described (or exemplified) in the second are found to be satisfied in the first. An exact match is such a comparison for which all of the criteria of the second are found to be satisfied in the first. The approach presented in this paper is to transform the set of criteria for class membership into an exemplary instance of a member of the class, which exhibits a set of characteristics whose presence is necessary and sufficient for membership in that class.

"This work is part of a thesis project for the Master of Science degree in Computer Science. The objective of the project is to create a software link between a PDP-11/34 minicomputer running under the UNIX operating system and a DEC-10, both at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville.This link provides the PDP-11 users the capability of batch job submission to the DEC-10. The hardware involved is minimal -either machine views the other as a simple terminal. The actual software that handles the communication is a simple process, not part of the operating system, per se.A special device driver routine (added to the operating system) is necessary to handle the I/O under UNIX. The existing device driver routine has a limited buffer size of 256 characters. The communication software which reads this buffer competes for machine resources with the same priority as other user processes. Therefore, a buffer overrun and consequent information loss can occur unless the output of the DEC-10 is automatically inhibited by the device driver until buffer space is available.At any time, a user of the PDP-11 can submit a file of commands to be interpreted line by line by either the DEC system or the UNIX system. This submission merely results in the request being queued as a batch process to be later initiated by an operator. When initiated by the operator, the queue of requests is serviced individually by first logging into the requesting user's DEC account (this information is system maintained). Any output produced by the DEC system is stored in a file with the entry in the user's directory. The entire implementation is in the C language.",['Mukesh Sundaram'],0,,UNIX to DEC-10: a simple teleprocessing link,,1979,81a90435-b726-4849-ad42-4058492af88f
"An event-driven, time-based stochastic simulation model may be modified in a straightforward manner to satisfy the axioms of a discrete-state, continuous-time Markov chain. The method requires casting the probability distribution of each random variable representing a time interval of the process into the form of a series of exponentially-distributed stages. An algorithm for this transformation has been developed. The technique is demonstrated via a simple example of a computer system simulation. The Markov chain representation of the simulation can be solved numerically, providing an independent verification of the logic of the simulation.","['Andrew S. Noetzel', 'Elaine J.

The purpose of this paper is to present an approach for verifying that explicitely stated integrity constraints are not violated by certain transactions. We utilize a relational model where-in constraints are given in a language based on the first order predicate calculus. Transactions are written in terms of an ALGOL.60 like host language with embedded first order predicate calculus capabilities allowing queries and updates. The technique for proving consistency of the transactions is based upon the Hoare axiomatic approach. We illustrate the method by means of an explicit example of a database updated by four types of transaction. A generalized transaction consistency verifier embodying this approach would considerably enhance transaction programming in a relational database management system.,"['Georges Gardarin', 'Michel A.

"A new pattern recognition scheme with learning ability is introduced, and its application to the labeling of phonemes is reported. The basic classification algorithm is known as the subspace method in which classes of patterns are defined as linear vector subspaces spanned by the prototypes, and the class affiliation of an unknown pattern vector is decided by comparison of its orthogonal projections on the various subspaces. This method is here modified in two ways. In one of them, the prototype patterns are selected conditionally according to classification results obtained during training. In the second modification the subspaces are rotated in proper directions in the training procedure, depending on the classification results. By means of these methods, for the average accuracy of classification with 15 phonemic classes from continuous Finnish speech, a value of about 80 per cent was obtained.","['Teuvo Kohonen', 'Németh G', 'K.

In this paper a method is described for solving linearly constrained nonlinear programming problems without evaluating any derivatives of the objective function. The algorithm uses the concept of active constraints and avoids the calculation of derivatives by approximating modified gradients and Hessian matrices by the aid of differences of function values. These approximations are calculated in such a way that the same convergence results are obtained as for any Quasi-Newton method.,['Jürgen Bräuninger'],50,['c8d5c682-4845-4bd7-829e-5129657c0bab'],A quasi-Newton method for minimization under linear constraints without evaluating any derivatives,Computing,1979,23a1d0d7-d8bb-4311-866a-7afbc890449e

"This paper describes a method for enhancing speech corrupted by broadband noise. The method is based on the spectral noise subtraction method. The original method entails subtracting an estimate of the noise power spectrum from the speech power spectrum, setting negative differences to zero, recombining the new power spectrum with the original phase, and then reconstructing the time waveform. While this method reduces the broadband noise, it also usually introduces an annoying ""musical noise"". We have devised a method that eliminates this ""musical noise"" while further reducing the background noise. The method consists in subtracting an overestimate of the noise power spectrum, and preventing the resultant spectral components from going below a preset minimum level (spectral floor). The method can automatically adapt to a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios, as long as a reasonable estimate of the noise spectrum can be obtained. Extensive listening tests were performed to determine the quality and intelligibility of speech enhanced by our method. Listeners unanimously preferred the quality of the processed speech. Also, for an input signal-to-noise ratio of 5 dB, there was no loss of intelligibility associated with the enhancement technique.","['Michael G. Berouti', 'Richard M.

"One of the most important ideas in the theory of sequencing and scheduling is the method of adjacent pairwise job interchange. This method compares the costs of two sequences which differ only by interchanging a pair of adjacent jobs. In 1956, W. E. Smith defined a class of problems for which a total preference ordering of the jobs exists with the property that in any sequence, whenever two adjacent jobs are not in preference order, they may be interchanged with no resultant cost increase. In such a case the unconstrained sequencing problem is easily solved by sequencing the jobs in preference order.#R##N##R##N#In this paper, a natural subclass of these problems is considered for which such a total preference ordering exists for all subsequences of jobs.

"The extensible set language (ESL) uses clusters for extending the set oriented language and for mapping the sets and their operators into base language data structure and operators. The main difficulty in this mapping is the dependency among clusters, i.e., the use of one data structure requires the modification or the constraint of another. The dialogue is a compile time procedure which is part of a cluster. It manipulates data structures and enables each cluster to appear independent; it also enables the user to choose one of a family of data implementations defmed by the cluster.

A new method of achieving diagonal dominance for Nyquist array design methods is presented. The technique utilizes a conjugate direction function minimization algorithm to obtain dominance over a specified frequency range by minimizing the ratio of the moduli of the off-diagonal terms to the moduli of the diagonal terms of the appropriate open loop transfer matrix. The new dominance algorithm is easily implemented in either a batch or interactive computer mode and will yield dominant compensators when alternative methods fail. Several concepts new to the Nyquist array methods are also presented. The proposed method is applied to the control system design for a sixteenth order state model of the Pratt-Whitney F-100 turbofan engine with three inputs.,['G. G.

"This paper describes the design of a language intended for use in a data base environment. The language is of interest for several reasons. It is used as a vehicle to introduce the concept of transformation grammar as a basis for describing a high level programming language. We will show that a transformational grammar may define a natural English-like language while providing an efficient method for language recognition. Another important aspect of the language is its data view, in that data files are the processing unit, rather than in dividual records. Finally, the language is well suited to the programming orientation of viewing a program in terms of data mappings, allowing a more structured approach to programming. The examples presented in this paper are framed in terms of logical data structures. Because of the modular nature of the language processor, any physical data organization and data base implementation can be supported. In particular, both CODASYL-type and relational data bases C 1,23 can be handled via the appropriate transformations. This paper has two basic goals. One is to describe the language in both theoretical and practical terms. This is done primarily through the use of examples. The second goal is the introduction of the linguistic techniques used to define the language. These include transformational grammars. The purpose is not to be tutorial, but to indicate the nature of the technique.","['Robert H. Bonczek', 'Mike Gagle', 'Andrew B.

"The aim of this report is to show the feasibility of automatic hardware verification based on functional abstraction. This is defined as the process of extracting the behavior of a product from its static structural description. A general discussion of possible approaches to design verification points out that functional abstraction is a very important part of any system for automatic hardware verification.   Some of the tools developed for proofs of program correctness can be used when dealing with digital designs. In the present paper, the problems specific to hardware verification are singled out and investigated. Several tools specific to design verification, that were developed during the reported research, are briefly reviewed.   The appendix begins with results of automatic analysis of basic modules (actual TTL components: flip-flops and an adder). These modules are then used in the realisation of more complex circuits. As an instructive example, three different designs implementing the same specifications are analyzed, and it is shown that the reported system is able to extract their common behavior.","['Sany M.

"An Analysis of Prepaging. Prepaging is advocated as a technique to reduce the excessive page traffic due to the changes in the phases of execution of a program. Common prepaging techniques are surveyed. It is advocated that the phase transition behavior cannot be adequately predicted based either on the spatial contiguity or on the observation of the past behavior. Prepaging advice generated by the programmer or the compiler is presented as a technique for the prediction of the phase transition behavior. To simplify the generation of the prepaging advice, the processes of the extraction of the phase transition behavior and the schedufing of the page transfers are decoup~ed. This, in turn, dictates the need for controlled prepaging, which is discussed next. / A performance comparison of a sequential prepaging scheme and a user-aided prepaging scheme is carried out.

It discusses current software engineering practice with respect to lessons learned in the past few years, and concludes that the lessons are currently not heeded roughly half of the time.

"In comparison with such objective aspects of program quality as efficiency and correctness, readability is elusive and hard-to-measure. Since it is surely an important factor in the cost of maintaining a program over its lifetime, the usefulness of an accurate and inexpensive measure of readability is obvious. In an attempt to find such a measure, a set of 30 Algol 68 programs written by students in an upper-level course was graded by hand for readability and the results compared with a set of program parameters extracted by a SNOBOL program. Correlation and multiple regression techniques were used to test hypotheses suggested in the literature on program quality, and to find a combination of parameters with maximum predictive value. A set of three variables was found to be effective in predicting readability.","['Gerrit E. DeYoung', 'Garry R.

"It is reasonable to assume in many temperature control applications, that disturbance signals, i.e. solar insolation, ambient temperature, etc. are periodic with 24 hour period and that these periodic disturbances persist over a sufficiently long time interval to allow the system response to settle into a steady-state periodic mode. In this study a linear model is assumed for the system being controlled. The steady-state average of an integral quadratic measure is selected as a performance index. Disturbance signals are assumed to be representable by Fourier series expansions. The periodic optimal control input, which minimizes the given performance index, is then computed in terms of its Fourier coefficient. The optimal control-input coefficients are obtained explicitly in terms of disturbance-input coefficients.","['Peter Dorato', 'Harold K.

"In the discrimination problem the random variable \theta , known to take values in {1, \cdots ,M} , is estimated from the random vector X .

"Locking granularity refers to the size and hence the number of locks used to ensure the consistency of a database during multiple concurrent updates. In an earlier simulation study we concluded that coarse granularity, such as area or file locking, is to be preferred to fine granularity such as individual page or record locking.  However, alternate assumptions than those used in the original paper can change that conclusion. First, we modified the assumptions concerning the placement of the locks on the database with respect to the accessing transactions. In the original model the locks were assumed to be well placed. Under worse case and random placement assumptions when only very small transactions access the database, fine granularity is preferable.  Second, we extended the simulation to model a lock hierarchy where large transactions use large locks and small transactions use small locks. In this scenario, again under the random and worse case lock placement assumptions, fine granularity is preferable if all transactions accessing more than 1 percent of the database use large locks.  Finally, the simulation was extended to model a “claim as needed” locking strategy together with the resultant possibility of deadlock. In the original study all locks were claimed in one atomic operation at the beginning of a transaction. The claim as needed strategy does not change the conclusions concerning the desired granularity.","['Daniel R.

Moreover, we can easily test a formula to see if it is evaluable. Finally, we show how it is possible to deduce from a formula the conditions which have to be ful-filled by the predicate argument validity domains in order to obtain answers which are not an empty set.

"The power of an experienced medical diagnostician seens to us to arise from a knowledge organization whose very structure helps keep the combinatorial growth of processing under control. Thin structure mirrors the deep conceptual structure of the field. We propose a knowledge representation scheme called conceptual structures, which organizes knowledge in the form of production rules or nore complex procedures In such a way that they are accessed and used as needed. This structure is doninantly hierarchical, the successors of a conceptual node standing for subconcepts which refine that concept. Associated with each concept is a set of procedures (experts) which attempt to apply the relevant knowledge to the case at hand; this might include turninc over control to selected subconcepts for more detailed analysis. Thus, abstractly, the conccntual structure organizes the invocation of procedures available to the diagnostician. The calling of a special 1st by a physician is skin, we think, to control transfer to a subconcept in the cognitive structure of a diagnostician during problem solving; the difference is in the level of detail of the cognitive map. In this Paper, sore principles governing the design of conceptual structures are presented.

On the basis of the resulting data it could be concluded that if augmentation had not been provided during the assessment periods approximately 19% of the program officers' output and 25% of the secretary's output would have been lost.

The paper begins with several microeconomic concepts related to energy conservation and to energy-economy interactions. We then examine three representative medium-term models which deal with pricing, import policy and investment decisions in today's conventional supply technologies. Next, we analyze four studies dealing with longer-range issues-alternative research and development strategies for a transition away from depletable energy resources.

"Abstract#R##N##R##N#ABSTRACT#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#In this paper, we present exact and approximate algorithms for the problem of optimal network design, which was first studied by Ridley [15], Stairs [17] and Scott [16], among others. Given a network, the problem consists in selecting a subset of links that minimizes the sum of shortest routes between all nodes subject to a budget constraint. Congestion effects are not considered. First, we refine a branch-and-bound algorithm proposed by Hoang [7] and we compare the resuling algorithm to an algorithm developed by Boyce et al. [1]. Our conclusion is that these exact algorithms perform adequately on medium size problems; however, for larger problems, approximate methods based on heuristic approaches are necessary. We then introduce two new heuristic approaches and test their computational efficiency as well as that of two other already known heuristics. The new heuristics presented produce excellent results. Finally, we consider more general versions of the problem.","['R.

"This paper investigates the effects of vesting rules and termination rates on the accumulation of pensionable service. First, a theoretical framework is developed, through stochastic models in continuous time, to characterize the cumulative pensionable service with reference to its moments, under an arbitrary age-service vesting rule. In the most general case, the rate of employment termination is allowed to be a function of both age and time spent in an employment. Next, a discrete computational model is presented for the determination of the distribution of pensionable service and of related measures, using age and service-dependent termination rates as input. This model is applied to Canadian Public Service and the results are discussed. Also considered are the employer's perspective and passage from pensionable service to pension benefits.","['Izzet Sahin', 'Yves Balcer']",50,[],Stochastic Models for Pensionable Service,Operations Research,1979,b46ef2a7-358c-4f29-9a99-9002ff8a14d1
"An analytical approach to the design of logical database structures is presented. Inputs to the model consist of data item types and volume, associations among items, security constraints, and item access frequencies required to satisfy known database applications. The output is a prototype database management system (DBMS) processable schema for a hierarchical and/or network database structure. The design problem is formulated as an integer programming problem and the branch and bound method is used to generate an optimal solution for the parameters specified. The objective function to be minimized is logical record access, subject to constraints on record size and total database size. Experience with the model has shown it to be an excellent predictor of real performance, easy to use, and have relatively low computing cost for moderately-sized database design problems. Use of the model is illustrated through an example problem and its solution. Direct comparison with a previous methodology clearly establishes the superiority of the current approach.","['Keki B.

If F ⊆ G, the interval between F and G is the collection of subsets F with F ⊆ F′ ⊆ G. The probability of an event corresponding to an interval is easy to calculate and the probability that the system operates is simply the sum of the event probabilities corresponding to the intervals in the partition.

"This paper presents a new clustering algorithm for analyzing unordered discrete-valued data. This algorithm consists of a cluster initiation phase and a sample regrouping phase. The first phase is based on a data-directed valley detection process utilizing the optimal second-order product approximation of high-order discrete probability distribution, together with a distance measure for discrete-valued data. As for the second phase, it involves the iterative application of the Bayes' decision rule based on subgroup discrete distributions. Since probability is used as its major decision criterion, the proposed method minimizes the disadvantages of yielding solutions sensitive to the arbitrary distance measure adopted. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by applying it to four different sets of simulated data and a set of clinical data. For performance comparison, the decision-directed algorithm [11] is also applied to the same set of data. These evaluation experiments fully demonstrate the validity and the operational feasibility of the proposed algorithm and its superiority as compared to the decision-directed algorithm.","['Andrew K.

"In the database field, the requirement of high level facilities for retrieval/update operations is now increasing rapidly. Our approach from the relational database point of view for contribution to this problem is to provide 1) efficient processing of relational retrieval/ update operations, and 2) a high level user interface. In order to achieve this goal, a new concept concerning ""abstracted characteristics"" is presented. Abstracted characteristics are defined to be characteristics abstracted from sets of tuples in relations stored in the database. A classification of abstracted characteristics is presented. Functional dependencies, which play an important role in relational database design, and time-dependent functional dependencies are pointed out to be useful in processing retrieval/update operations. Some important applications of abstracted characteristics are discussed.

A method is presented for analyzing the performance of M-ary coherent phase-shift-keyed (CPSK) signals which have been transmitted through a hard limiting channel in the presence of linear intersymbol interference preceding the limiter and additive Gaussian noise both preceding and following it. The probability of error is obtained in the form of an infinite series as a function of the expected values of trigonometric functions of the interference. The characteristic function of the interference is expanded in a power series and used to obtain these expected values. The resulting error probability is obtained as the product of two absolutely convergent series. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the technique.,"['Nimal Ekanayake', 'Desmond P.

"An in-place reversible sorting algorithm is used following a fast Walsh transform to sort coefficients into increasing sals followed by decreasing cals. This separation of the coeffic ients into those arising from odd sinelike time functions and those from even cosinelike functions is useful in signal processing applications.

The separation of the transform and sort functions has resulted in simple implementations for each. To demonstrate the differences in the sort routines, transform results and their inverses are made on a linear ramp. For this application the transform results with sal-cal sorting has all zeros beyond the mid-point showing that, with the exception of the large d.c. term, the linear ramp is composed entirely of Walsh odd time functions.","['Errol E.

It takes into account the statistical properties of the main impairments that affect the information signal, i.e., shot noise (dark current included), thermal noise, and intersymbol interference. Unlike other methods, the analysis of shot-noise statistics does not entail the second-moment characterization alone, but uses a number of moments sufficient to evaluate the error probability with a high degree of accuracy. For this purpose it is shown how the cumulants of shot noise and intersymbol interference of any order can be computed. The baseband pulse response and the statistical distribution of the avalanche-photodetector gain are assumed to be available. Moreover, techniques for exploiting the cumulants are given; knowledge of the cumulants allows one to compute the probability of error by means of Gaussian numerical integration rules.

"Attention is focused on the theory concerning comparisons of single-firm market structures and certain multifirm alternatives to such structures. Firms are assumed to produce a single commodity with which is associated a price as well as a numerical index of quality. Considered first is the case in which the single firm is assumed to be profit-maximizing, and the price and quality of the commodity produced are compared with the corresponding quantities associated with a certain legislated-into-existence multifirm alternative consisting of a number of essentially identical profit-maximizing firms which produce the commodity at a uniform price and level of quality. Certain assumptions are introduced and it is proved, in a general and realistic setting concerning the number of possible solutions of the basic underlying optimization problems, that the single-firm structure outperforms the multifirm alternative in a significant sense having to do with prices and levels of quality. The remainder of the paper is concerned with the situation in which the alternative to the single-firm structure consists of a dominant firm (which sets the price and level of quality of the commodity) as well as a fringe of competitive firms whose combined total output capability is typically comparatively small. It is shown that if the single firm and dominant firm are profit-maximizing companies, and ifcertain other conditions are met, then the presence of the competitive fringe benefits the consumer in, for example, the following sense.",['I.

Unfortunately, this mechanism also introduces its own distortion. A method for compensating for the leakage-induced distortion is proposed here. It consists of a quite novel generalization of the adaptive quantizer with the novelty contained entirely in the decoding procedure. The generalization is illustrated by a PCM and a DPCM example.

The estimates satisfy the input-output equations and are optimal in a weighted minimum variance sense. It is shown that the true optimum problem is too complicated to allow a general closed-form solution and a sub-optimal approach is suggested that leads to a simple computational algorithm.,['Janos Gertler'],50,['27c2ea58-54d8-4c56-84e4-6a375393438b'],Brief paper: A constrained minimum variance input-output estimator for linear dynamic systems,Automatica,1979,86fa0d47-9f2f-4431-8ca8-37f9b88df53f

"Abstract#R##N##R##N#Scope: The purpose of this study was to explore the use and effectiveness of current awareness (CA) methods, especially SDI, among chemists at Canadian universities. Method: We used a questionnaire which was mailed to a sample of 170 (response rate 80%). The variables studied include perceived scatter of information, use of various CA methods, time spent on CA, perceived success in CA, and CA efficiency = success/time spent. The results of this explanatory study are tentative. Major results: Keeping up-to-date is more difficult in specialties with high scatter of information (hypothesis 5). SDI seems to be the only method capable of counteracting scatter (hypotheses 5–7). In contrast, if scatter is low, SDI use decreases CA efficiency (hypothesis 6a); scanning journals, the most prevalent CA method, seems to be sufficient for low-scatter specialties. High scatter does not lead to increased SDI use, in some cases due to perceived difficulty of profile construction (hypothesis 3a). Conclusions: SDI services should concentrate efforts on serving scientists in specialties with high scatter of information by developing systems that are capable of searching across conventional disciplines and specialties, by providing assistance in profile development, and by conducting a marketing campaign directed toward these scientists.","['Katherine H.

"The problem of quantizing a two-dimensional random variable whose bivariate density has circular symmetry is considered in detail. Two quantization methods are considered, leading to polar and rectangular representations. A simple necessary and sufficient condition is derived to determine which of these two quantization schemes is best. If polar quantization is deemed best, the question arises as to the ratio of the number of phase quantizer levels to that or magnitude quantizer levels when the product of these numbers is fixed. A simple expression is derived for this ratio that depends only upon the magnitude distribution. Several examples of common circularly symmetric bivariate densities are worked out in detail using these expressions.","['James A.

In this paper we examine certain problems related to the use of diffusion approximations for the approximate modelling of computer systems. In particular we develop a model which allows us to handle waiting times and batch arrivals: these results are a new approach to the use of diffusion approximations. We also examine the effect of the distribution of holding times at boundaries: this question had remained open in earlier studies. We show that the stationary distributions associated with these diffusion models depend only on the average residence time of the process on the boundaries and not on the complete distribution function.

"Aggregate advertising models relate product sales to advertising spending for a market as a whole. Although many models have been built, they frequently contradict each other and considerable doubt exists as to which models best represent advertising processes. An increasingly rich literature of empirical studies helps resolve these issues by revealing major advertising phenomena that models should encompass. These include sales responding upward and downward at different rates, steady state response that can be concave or S-shaped and can have positive sales at zero advertising, sales affected by competitive advertising; and advertising dollar effectiveness that can change over time. A review of aggregate models developed on a priori grounds brings out similarities and differences among those of Vidale and Wolfe, Nerlove and Arrow, Little, and others and identifies ways in which the models agree or disagree with observed phenomena. A Lanchester-motivated structure generalizes many features of these model...",['John D. C.

"A relatively new datatype, called a block, was designed and implemented by James F. Gimpel in the SNOBOL4 programming language[1,2]. SNOBOL4[3] being an interpreter, requires significantly more execution time and memory than a compiler. To overcome this deficiency, Robert B. K. Dewar and Kenneth E. Belcher, at the Illinois Institute of Technology, designed a speedy implementation of SNOBOL4 known as SPITBOL[4]. SPITBOL is a compiler, it requires less time and memory than SNOBOL4. At the time SPITBOL was written, the block datatype was not included. This paper describes an external routine which was developed to add the block datatype to SPITBOL. The availability of blocks in SPITBOL opens many new paths for data structures in the field of non-numeric applications. Three dimensional data structures can be used in many areas of computer science. For example, l) Computer Graphics, displaying three dimensional geographic locations on a two dimensional surface; 2) Artificial Intelligence, scene analysis and mechanical theorem proving; and 3) Business Applications, displaying reports and statements (overprinting to highlight important items).",['Mark Alan Darholt'],0,[],An implementation of 'blocks' in SPITBOL,,1979,750a202a-164c-40d2-ad95-ef4b381c9154

Nineteen speakers, ten male and nine female, generated a data set comprising the nine isolated fricative consonants, each followed by three different vowels.

Then this classification system was applied to an ""unknown"" set of utterances of the remaining ten voices. This prediction experiment yielded 74% accuracy.

This paper generalizes the problem in two ways. First, the edge's capacity is time dependent, and secondly, the heldover of flows in the vertices may be prohibited during certain intervals of time. The presence of these two additional features implies that cycling of flows may be necessary in order to generate an optimal solution, an impossible result in the original problem. The generalized maximal dynamic flows problem requires, therefore, a special method of solution, and the paper presents a suitable algorithm which solves the problem.",['Jonathan Halpern'],50,"['7e47c359-8d2b-40a6-ac5a-4eceae80f338', '86e4a37e-ba69-4497-8076-d6ffcb7066e2', 'b6e82871-cb31-420e-96c8-0cfa149086cd']",A generalized dynamic flows problem,Networks,1979,548910b8-b254-4722-a2e8-78cabf20c692

The incidence relation between gates and nets is represented by a graph H = (V, E), and a possible layout of gates and nets is characterized by an interval graph H = (V,E O F), where F is called an augmentation. It is shown that the number of tracks required for between-gate wiring is equal to the clique number (chromatic number) of H, and hence the optimum placement problem is converted to that of minimum clique number augmentation. This turns out to be an NP-complete problem. Instead a polynomial-time algorithm for finding a minimal augmentation is presented, where an augmentation is minimal if no proper subset of it is an augmentation.

"Only during the past decade has it been discovered how, under fairly reasonable conditions, to calculate a solution of a system of n nonlinear equations in n variables. The technique utilized was the so-called “complementarity” or “fixed point” approach to the Brouwer fixed point theorem. In this paper we extend that approach to calculate for certain systems not just one but all possible solutions. All solutions can be calculated when the equations of the system behave like a polynomial in the highest order terms. That is, in each equation the highest order term must be a variable raised to a power while the lower order terms can be more general.#R##N##R##N#Our procedure starts with a trivial system of equations, one to which all solutions are obvious and immedately known. The trivial system is then deformed into the system given with the unknown solutions.

In addition, a noise source is added at high frequencies to compensate for lack of energy during certain sounds. In this paper, we reexamine the whole HFR process. We show that the degree of rectification does not affect the output speech, and that, with proper processing, the high-frequency noise source may be eliminated. We introduce a new type of HFR based on spectral duplication of the baseband. Two types of spectral duplication are presented: spectral folding and spectral translation.

"This paper shows that by considering the instantaneous casualty-exchange ratio one can determine whether it is beneficial for the victor to commit as many forces as possible to battle initially in Lanchester-type combat between two homogeneous forces. It considers the initial-commitment decision as a one-sided static optimization problem and examines this nonlinear program for each of three decision criteria victor's losses, loss ratio, and loss difference and for each of two different battle-termination conditions given force-level breakpoint and given force-ratio breakpoint. The main contribution is to show how to determine the sign of the partial derivative of the decision criterion with respect to the victor's initial force level for general combat dynamics without explicitly solving the Lanchester-type combat equations. Consequently, the victor's optimal initial-commitment decision may often be determined from how the instantaneous casualty-exchange ratio varies with changes in the victor's force level and time. Convexity of the instantaneous casualty-exchange ratio is shown to imply convexity of the decision criterion so that conditions of decreasing marginal returns may be identified also without solving the combat equations.

"This paper describes a technique for designing IIR digital filters to a desired magnitude-squared frequency response with auxiliary constraints to control coefficient quantization sensitivity. The procedure can be used to design IIR filters for direct form implementation with a reasonable number of bits, e.g., 12 or 16, in contrast to standard IIR filters which usually require parallel or cascade form realization because of quantization sensitivity. The method will design filters with response characteristics that provide a continuous link between conventional IIR and FIR filters. The relative control simplicity associated with the direct form is shown to have advantages in special-purpose hardware implementations of low-sensitivity IIR filters using LSI arithmetic function circuits. A design example and its 12-bit hardware realization are described.","['Michael T. McCallig', 'Richard R.

The problem of image enhancement by nonlinear two-dimensional (2-D) homomorphic filtering is approached using stochastic models of the signal and degradations. Homomorphic filtering has been used previously for image enhancement but the linear filtering operation has generally been chosen heuristically. In this paper stochastic image models described and analyzed previously by the authors are used to model the true image and interferring components (shadows and salt-and-pepper noise). The problem of designing the linear operation can then be formulated as one of linear least mean-squared error (Wiener) filtering.

This description can be used for learning and recognition of texture images. We also present a new idea for evaluating texture analyzers. In order to directly see what essential features or structures of the given textures each analyzer extracts, we propose an analysis-by-synthesis method.

"The query programs of certain databases report raw statistics for query sets, which are groups of records specified implicitly by a characteristic formula. The raw statistics include query set size and sums of powers of values in the query set. Many users and designers believe that the individual records will remain confidential as long as query programs refuse to report the statistics of query sets which are too small. It is shown that the compromise of small query sets can in fact almost always be accomplished with the help of characteristic formulas called trackers. Schlorer's individual tracker is reviewed; it is derived from known characteristics of a given individual and permits deducing additional characteristics he may have. The general tracker is introduced: It permits calculating statistics for arbitrary query sets, without requiring preknowledge of anything in the database. General trackers always exist if there are enough distinguishable classes of individuals in the database, in which case the trackers have a simple form. Almost all databases have a general tracker, and general trackers are almost always easy to find. Security is not guaranteed by the lack of a general tracker.","['Dorothy E. Denning', 'Peter J.

"This paper, in two parts, describes some novel algorithms for pattern recognition research and a framework for efficient development, maintenance, and sharing of Interactive software amongst several users and diverse application areas. This modular interactive software system (MISS) forms the basis of a general purpose image analysis and pattern recognition research system (IPS) implemented in the Macdonald Stewart Biomedical Image Processing Laboratory at McGill University. The first part of the paper discusses the algorithms and some preliminary results. Two algorithms are singled out. The first is an interactive approach to nouparametric feature selection via two-dimensional mapping of the multidimension al minimal spanning tree of the features in pattern space. Some preliminary results of the performance of the algorithm, in the automatic mode, applied to feature selection for cervical cell classification, are presented. The second algorithm is an exact procedure for condensing the training data, in the nearest neighbor decision rule, which yields a minimal set of points that implements precisely the original nearest neighbor decision boundary. The second part of the paper describes the MISS and IPS software systems. The MISS software implementation framework insures software colbpati bility and sharing among many individuals and diverse applications, provides safeguard against software loss, and supports an extendable high level interactive language with on-line document ation. MISS language support includes a BASE LAN GUAGE interpreter (implementing a variant of FORTRAN) plus an EXTENDED LANGUAGE interpreter that facilitates addition of new groups of language statements. Each group of statements is associated with a particular function, application area, or programmer. A-11 IPS software has been implemented within the MISS framework. The present IPS implementation includes over 300 EXTENDED LANGUAGE statements in twenty groups facilitating such functions as: image acquisition and display, simulation of a hardware image processor, data management, image manipulation and filtering, graphics, image segmentation and feature extraction, feature selection, classification, and classification per formance measurement. The overall design philosophy of the MISS and IPS software systems and the ease with which new software can be added and documented are described.","['Godfried T. Toussaint', 'Ron S.

"In many three-dimensional imaging applications random shaped objects, reconstructed from serial sections, are isolated to display their overall structure in a single view. This paper presents an algorithm to control an ordered search strategy for locating all contours of random shaped objects intersected by a series of cross-section image planes. Classic search techniques in AI problem solving and software for image processing and computer graphics are combined here to aid program initialization and automate the search process thereafter. Using three-dimensional region growing, this method isolates all spatially connected pixels forming a structure's volume and enters image planes the least number of times to do so.

"The count of events where sample areas from the second and subsequent frames of a TV-image sequence are incompatible with the corresponding sample area of the first frame are accumulated in a first-order difference picture (FODP). Analysis of this FODP provides a separate estimate for images of moving objects and of stationary scene components. We start from the hypothesis that the first frame represents the stationary scene component. Once it has been recognized that a subarea of this initial estimate corresponds to the image of a moving object, the grey values in this subarea are replaced by later estimates of the stationary background at this position.

The core of the paper is self-contained, consisting as it does essentially of the two notions of “p-definability” and the five algebraic relations that are proved as theorems.

"Reflectance map techniques make explicit the relationship between image intensity and surface orientation. In general, however, trade-offs between image intensity and surface shape emerge which cannot be resolved in a single view. Existing methods for determining shape from a single view embody assumptions about surface curvature. The image Hessian matrix is introduced as a convenient viewer-centered representation of surface curvature. Properties of surface curvature are expressed as properties of the Hessian matrix. For several classes of surfaces, image analysis simplifies. This result has already been established for planar surfaces. Similar simplification is demonstrated for singly curved surfaces and for the subclass of doubly curved surfaces known as generalized cones. These studies help to delineate shape information that can be determined from object boundaries and shape information that can be determined from shading.",['Robert J.

"A system must operate for T units of time. T is a random variable with known distribution function F. A certain component is essential for the system's operation and when it fails must be replaced with a new component. There are n possible types of replacements. An unlimited supply of each type is assumed. A type i replacement costs cici > 0 and functions independently of T for an exponentially distributed length of time with rate λi. The problem is to assign the replacements from among the various possible types so as to minimize the expected total cost of providing an operative component for the entire life of the system. The principal result of this paper, generalizing previous work where T was assumed to have a degenerate or truncated exponential distribution, is that if F is an increasing failure rate function IFR the optimal replacement policy has a simple intuitive interval structure. An algorithm for finding the optimal policy is indicated. Some results are obtained for the case where component life distributions are not exponential.","['Cyrus Derman', 'Donald R.

Both are described in terms of Kaplan's General Syntactic Processor formalism. This analysis shows that 'conceptual dependency' and 'active semantic networks' have little or nothing to do with the actual functioning of the parsers.

"This paper results from an attempt to unify several different file system design theories. We define a term ""partial match pattern"" and show that in order to produce file systems optimal with respect to partial match patterns, both the multikey hashing (MKH) method [16] and the multidimensional directory (MDD) method [11] must be in such a form that the number of subdivisions is the same for all domains of keys. We show the conditions for the string homomorphism hashing (SHH) method [15], the MKH method, and the MDD method to be equivalent to one another. We define the so-called Cartesian product files and show that if all records are present, the records in a Cartesian product file form a shortest spanning path in which the Hamming distance between every pair of consecutive records is 1. Thus the SHH method, the MKH method, the MDD method, and the multikey sorting (MKS) method [10] are linked together. Finally, we show that for both partial and best match queries, the file systems exhibit a common characteristic: similar records are grouped together.","['W.C. Lin', 'Richard C. T. Lee', 'H.C.

"To fill a connected area of a digital image is to change the color of all and only those pixels in the area. Fill algorithms for areas defined by sharp boundaries (e.g., a white area surrounded by a black curve) have been implemented at several color computer graphics installations. This paper presents an algorithm for the more difficult problem of filling areas with shaded boundaries (e.g., a white area surrounded by a curve consisting of several shades of gray). These images may arise from digitizing photographs or line drawings with a scanning video camera, or they may be generated by programs which produce antialiased line segments or dekink black-and-white images. When an area in such an image is to be filled with a new color, it is desirable to have the fill algorithm understand the shaded edges and maintain the shading with shades of the new color instead of the old. The tint fill algorithm presented here accomplishes this task. Its name arises from its ability to change only the tint (hue and saturation) of a pixel, leaving the value (blackness) unchanged. Although the algorithm was motivated by and is written in terms of color, it has a more general interpretation, which is also presented.",['Alvy Ray Smith'],88,"['1994a997-6a28-497a-9a42-394da5e9a959', 'ec8bef55-4e73-4e6f-a818-cebf2bd51a29', 'ed965179-c88b-4ad9-850b-952dc8e1e3d0', 'f4021f85-8f42-4b8d-94bf-720e76742911']",Tint fill,international conference on computer graphics and interactive techniques,1979,ccb21c61-0ef0-4008-a24d-3fac4531ed49

"Software maintenance has been the dominant factor contributing to the high cost of software. In this paper, the software maintenance process and the important software quality attributes that affect the maintenance effort are discussed. Among these quality attributes, the stability of a program, which indicates the resistance to the potential ripple effect that the program would have when it is modified, is an important one. Measures for estimating the stability of a program and the modules of which the program is composed are presented, and an algorithm for computing these stability measures is given. Application of these measures during the maintenance phase is discussed along with an example. Further research efforts involving validation of the stability measures, application of these measures during the design phase, and restructuring based on these measures are also discussed.","['Stephen S.

"This paper is concerned with the representation of objects by computer. It presents a compact relational structure representation derived by generalizing the properties of objects. Objects are described by means of surface primitives (basic descriptive elements) and relations between the primitives. The essence of the representation is the use of a single primitive to describe all identical parts. The representation involves abstracting properties of individual scene elements. Similarly, relations between parts of objects that hold for particular instances of the objects are generalized to ensure that they will be valid for all instances. Common primitives and relations are shared both within and across models. This leads to a compact representation that has many desirable properties. A computer implementation of a version of the representation has been developed. It is used to illustrate the descriptive power of the representation. A recognition system has been developed that takes advantage of the representation in its operation. It is described elsewhere (Shneier (1977), Shneier (1978)).",['Michael Shneier'],50,"['39d34886-2e54-4afb-ab7f-bb8be5637582', 'd95fa378-e5eb-4b14-9d6f-a7cd7f42f992']",A compact relational structure representation,international joint conference on artificial intelligence,1979,837c0577-d8ce-4e67-a79a-6203fa97cbd3

"An integral matrix with independent columns is called unimodular if the greatest common divisor of the determinants of its maximum-rank square submatrices is one.

"Features extracted by operators which examine diameter-limited gradient direction histograms are important because they describe images of industrial workpieces efficiently and have the potential for rapid computation via special purpose hardware. When such operators are passed over an image in raster fashion, features such as the following are detected: a strong peak in the direction histogram indicating the presence of a relatively straight edge, a second strong direction indicating a corner, a wide direction group indicating a curved edge, and a uniform distribution of directions over the histogram indicating small holes. Diameter-limited optimization can be used to substantially reduce the number of pixels which have been given feature labels by such operators without losing descriptive power. Feature labels for direction histograms having a second strong direction, a wide direction group, or a uniform distribution might be retained only if all other pixels within a circular aperture have a lower bin value. Pixels with a strong direction label might be retained only if all other pixels within a circular aperture and along the gradient direction have a smaller bin value. Tracking can then be applied to the remaining strong direction pixels in the direction perpendicular to the gradient to achieve representation of edges by endpoints.

"Abstract : The study describes a number of algorithms for solving single facility deterministic location problems in which the planar assumption is not appropriate. Transformations on the non-Euclidean spherical space are combined with efficient solution techniques in En. Extensive use is made of projective, synthetic and analytic geometry. Two algorithms are presented for solving single facility problems with the objective of minimizing the total sum of costs (minisum). Due to the non-convex nature of the problem, a local optimum is obtained. Computational experience in solving a number of test problems is reported. Theoretical results concerning narrowing of the search region are presented as well as a number of special properties of the problem. Application of the single facility results to the location-allocation class of multifacility minisum problem is investigated.","['W Daniel Litwhiler', 'Adel A.

"To the class of queuing networks analyzable by the method of Baskett, Chandy, Muntz, and Palacios, we add service centers whose scheduling is random. That is, upon completion of a service interval, the server chooses next to serve one of the waiting customers selected at random. As in the case of first-come first-served (FCFS) scheduling, all tasks must have the same exponentially distributed service time at such a center. We show that for purposes of this analysis, the results are identical to FCFS queuing. Example applications for random selection scheduling in computer system modeling are provided.",['Jeffrey R.

"A new family of unitary transforms is introduced. It is shown that the well-known discrete Fourier, cosine, sine, and the Karhunen-Loeve (KL) (for first-order stationary Markov processes) transforms are members of this family. All the member transforms of this family are sinusoidal sequences that are asymptotically equivalent. For finite-length data, these transforms provide different approximations to the KL transform of the said data. From the theory of these transforms some well-known facts about orthogonal transforms are easily explained and some widely misunderstood concepts are brought to light. For example, the near-optimal behavior of the even discrete cosine transform to the KL transform of first-order Markov processes is explained and, at the same time, it is shown that this transform is not always such a good (or near-optimal) approximation to the above-mentioned KL transform. It is also shown that each member of the sinusoidal family is the KL transform of a unique, first-order, non-stationary (in general), Markov process. Asymptotic equivalence and other interesting properties of these transforms can be studied by analyzing the underlying Markov processes.",['Anil K.

"An experiment was conducted to evaluate the use of data abstraction and to assess its effects on program modification. Programs developed using data-abstraction were found to be substantially larger than equivalent programs developed without it, and the larger abstract-data programs were more difficult to modify. No significant differences in programming error rates were found between programs with or without abstract datatypes. A subtle violation of one of data abstraction's primary objectives, hiding data representation details, was observed.

"Changes in Walsh-Hadamard power spectrum of an input pattern are investigated under several transformations: 1) shifting the elements of the input pattern cyclically, 2) enlarging and reducing the input pattern, 3) rotating the input pattern by multiples of 90°, and so on. Then the Walsh-Hadamard power spectrum is developed to be unchangeable by all the transformations through an introduced composing process. It may be considered as one of geometrical features. Every interesting geometrical property is generally invariant under some transformation groups. The composing process is available for obtaining functions having such group-invariant properties. The main idea is to make a linear combination of group-equivalent functions. First a G1-invariant power spectrum and next a permutation group on the G1-invariant power spectrum caused by G2 operating on the input pattern is found, thus arriving at a power spectrum being constant under both G1 and G2 through the composing process, where G1 and G2 are some transformation groups. Continuing this process, a power spectrum can be derived from the Walsh-Hadamard power spectrum that is invariant under a more general group of transformations.","['Hiromitsu Hama', 'Kazumi Yamashita']",0,[],Waish-Hadamard Power Spectra Invariant to Certain Transform Groups,systems man and cybernetics,1979,9f3ecf2c-73a5-4786-8441-8c4b5a263fe5

Neutron bombardment causes some of the atoms of the sample to change into unstable isotopes, which then decay, emitting gamma radiation at characteristic energies and intensities. By identifying the unstable isotopes, the composition of the original substance can be determined.

We derive an expression for the spectrum of the Cayley graph  X ( G , H ) in terms of irreducible characters of the group G:    λ     t      i,1   +…+λ     t       i,n     i     =  ∑  g     1   ,…,g     t   ∈H  Xi  Π  s=1  t  gs    for any natural number t, where  ξ   i   is an irreducible character (over   C  ), of degree  n   i   , and  λ   i  ,1 ,…,  λ   i , n   i    are eigenvalues of  X(G, H) , each one  n   i   times. ( σ   n   i   2  =  n  = |  G  | is the total'number of eigenvalues.) Using this formula for  t  = 1,…,  n   i   one can obtain a polynomial of degree  n   i   whose roots are  λ   i ,1 ,…, λ   i , n   i   . The results are formulated for directed graphs with colored edges. We apply the results to dihedral groups and prove the existence of k nonisomorphic Cayley graphs of  D   p   with the same spectrum provided  p  > 64 k , prime.",['László Babai'],120,[],Spectra of Cayley graphs,Journal of Combinatorial Theory,1979,7a9216ce-6258-4774-81fb-77a21e37dbcc
"The present paper proposes a mathematical theory of self-organizing nerve nets, which is applicable to various types of supervised and unsupervised learning, such as learning decision, concept formation, association, etc. Given an environmental information source, a neural system automatically forms a number of separate routines to process the signals in it. This kind of unsupervised self-organization underlies commonly in formation of categories, feature extractors, and content addressable memories. This problem is analyzed mathematically, as well as models of topographic organization of nerve fields and of associative memories, by the proposed method.",['Shun-ichi Amari'],0,['b3a164d1-1ed6-4016-b481-65a57f3964af'],Theory of self-organizing nerve nets with special reference to association and concept formation,international joint conference on artificial intelligence,1979,c9baf74a-d416-4a40-8871-ce1a6afd1f66

"In this part of the paper, the design philosophy of two software systems is discussed. The first, the Modular Interactive Software System MISS (1) is a general purpose interactive software system implementation framework within which purpose specific interactive software systems can be implemented. In addition to providing a framework within which to implement interactive software systems, the MISS system includes a software kernel which supports a high level interactive language plus several utility programs which facilitate the addition and documentation of new software modules implementing new statements in the interactive language. The second software system described here is a general purpose image analysis and pattern recognition research system IPS [1,2]. The IPS system is written within the MISS framework and consists of close to 300 extensions to the base level interactive language supported by the MISS system.

"Discrete event simulation studies of the Hyperchannel product of the Network Systems Corporation demonstrate surprising performance variations resulting from rather subtle protocol, timing, and topology changes. Early analytic and simulation studies showed the effectiveness of the lowest-level Hyperchannel contention mechanisms. Later simulations, including the next level of microcoded error and flow control protocols, showed that great care must be taken to maintain high trunk utilization through both protocol levels.

"This paper deals with the problem of determining the optimum time when testing can stop and the system be considered ready for operational use. This decision, of course, depends on the model for the software failure phenomenon and the criterion used for evaluating system readiness. Using the non-homogeneous Poisson process model of Goel and Okumoto [4], two criteria are investigated, viz the software reliability and total expected cost. A simple cost model is developed and the optimum release policy, based on cost criterion, is derived. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the results.","['Kazu Okumoto', 'Amrit L.

"In a programming project, it is easy to lose track of which files need to be reprocessed or recompiled after a change is made in some part of the source. Make provides a simple mechanism for maintaining up-to-date versions of programs that result from many operations on a number of files. It is possible to tell Make the sequence of commands that create certain files, and the list of files that require other files to be current before the operations can be done. Whenever a change is made in any part of the program, the Make command will create the proper files simply, correctly, and with a minimum amount of effort. The basic operation of Make is to find the name of a needed target in the description, ensure that all of the files on which it depends exist and are up to date, and then create the target if it has not been modified since its generators were. The description file really defines the graph of dependencies;Make does a depth-first search of this graph to determine what work is really necessary. Make also provides a simple macro substitution facility and the ability to encapsulate commands in a single file for convenient administration.",['Stuart I.

"Previous work in developing metrics of computer software using the methodology of Software Science has concentrated on relatively few program ming languages. More specifically, the experimental work has centered on programs written in Fortran, PL/I and Algol. While the results to date have provided the encouragement of further research in this direction, the apparent generality of the results mandates a study of other languages, par ticularly those whith substantially different characteristics and/or application areas than the similar, scientifically oriented languages of the previous work. This study concentrates on two such languages, namely COBOL and APL. The COBOL study contains programs obtained from an experiment given in an undergraduate pro gramming course, involving the relationship of Software Science metrics with programming time. The APL study contains twenty-nine programs obtained from several programming textbooks. Counting strategies for each language are described, main taining as much consistency with earlier Software Science work as possible.

"Any symbol in a redundant code can be recovered when it belongs to certain erasure patterns. Several alternative expressions of a given symbol, to be referred to as its replicas, can therefore be computed in terms of other ones. Decoding is interpreted as decoding upon a received symbol, given itself and a number of such replicas, expressed in terms of other received symbols. For linear q-ary (n,k) block codes, soft-decision demodulation and memoryless channels, the maximum-likelihood decision rule on a given symbol is formulated in terms of r \leqn - k linearly independent replicas from the parity-check equations. All replicas deriving from the r selected replicas by linear combination are actually taken into account in this decision rule. Its implementation can be direct; use transformations or a sequential circuit implementing a trellis representation of the parity-check matrix. If r = n - k , decoding is optimum, in the sense of symbol-by-symbol maximum-likelihoed. Simplification results in the transformed and sequential implementations when r  . If the selected replicas are disjoint, generalized ( q -ary, weighted) threshold decoding results. The decoding process can easily be modffied in order to provide word-by-word maximum-likelihood decoding. Convolutional codes are briefly considered. Two specific problems are discussed: the use of previous decisions, which leads to a weighted generalization of feedback decoding, and the extension of replication decoding to nonsystematic codes.","['Gérard Battail', 'Martine Decouvelaere', 'P.

"An arbitrary interleaved execution of transactions in a database system can lead to an inconsistent database state. A number of synchronization mechanisms have been proposed to prevent such spurious behavior. To gain insight into these mechanisms, we analyze them in a simple centralized system that permits one read operation and one write operation per transaction. We show why locking mechanisms lead to correct operation, we show that two proposed mechanisms for distributed environments are special cases of locking, and we present a new version of lockdng that alows more concurrency than past methods.

"A class of nonlinear receiver structures is described for the detection of weak signals in non-Gaussian narrowband noise. In particular, the concept of a locally optimum receiver structure is extended to the ease of narrowband signal and noise models. A useful class of non-Gaussian narrowband noise models is developed for which the locally optimum receiver implementation is explicitly determined. These structures are shown to provide considerable improvement over conventional linear receiver structures. The basis of comparison is taken as the asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE). Unfortunately, the locally optimum receiver requires explicit {sl a priori} knowledge of the underlying noise distribution. To circumvent this difficulty a rather simple adaptive nonlinear receiver structure is described which attempts to adapt to the unknown prevailing noise environment. This adaptive receiver is shown to provide fairly efficient and robust performance in a wide variety of non-Gaussian narrowband noise environments.","['James W. Modestino', 'Aaron Y.

Special emphasis is placed on what appear to be key ingredients to successfully applying the modeling approach. Further, the management implications of model-based policy analyses are considered.","['William B. Rouse', 'Sandra H.

"In languages such as Pascal, the programmer can arrange to have the compiler check such things as the range of the value of a variable only by defining a new type or sub-type. I have investigated how more powerful checking facilities might be provided if they were divorced from the type machinery, and also if the necessary language constructs were designed independent of what any particular compiler would check at compile-time.   The first part of the project is the language design. An important goal is that the programmer can have checked as little or as much as he cares, and that it is not necessary for the programmer to specify complete input and output specifications for the program. My work falls short of program verification not only because I wanted to be able to check a program quickly, but also because I was unwilling to force the programmer to specify the program in that much detail. Current program verification systems, such as that of Constable [Constable and Johnson, 1978] seem to require that the programmer write the program twice: once as a program and again as a proof.",['Graeme Williams'],50,"['0ad9aa47-e5db-4379-9453-7d9be4cece67', '23e87727-a573-4cbc-ad44-179a13fcf1b1', '5f51f095-db6f-4ef7-bb7e-9aaeeb59b3b9', '7bb71afa-91b8-46e7-9008-da84e0427b93', '8f31476e-05c4-4466-a8a8-ed275cb90295', 'de36f4b2-94b1-4c83-b94f-7cd7babf9d23']",Program checking,compiler construction,1979,bf2516eb-ca9a-4cb9-b533-c15f30092f01
"This paper, using actual data, establishes a dynamical model of sulfur dioxide pollution and gives an optimal discharge control policy for Osaka city in Japan. From a mass balance of the gas, a linear scalar state equation is obtained. In spite of the simplicity of the model, it can represent the effect of wind speed, inversion layer, diffusion, boundary concentration and discharge intensity of the pollutant sources. Six unknown parameters in the model and system noise variance are identified by maximizing likelihood function by Flexible Polyhedron Search. This makes the model reasonably representative. A quadratic loss function for the control problem is the weighted sum of two terms; the loss caused by the discharge control and the loss due to the air pollution. The wind speed varies at random according to a Markov transition matrix, considering actual emergency control situations. The optimal control policy is obtained by Dynamic Programming, resulting in linear feedback control dependent on the wind speed, involving a Riccati equation. A practical method of the determination of the weighting coefficient in the loss function is proposed. Since the model is a scalar state system, the whole calculation can be performed with a relatively small computer. This ease of computation and the Markov property of the wind speed suggest that the proposed method is applicable to the actual emergency discharge control.","['Hajime Akashi', 'Hiromitsu Kumamoto']",50,[],"Brief paper: Optimal sulfur dioxide gas discharge control for Osaka city, Japan",Automatica,1979,91079c9b-7d56-4428-89b2-4da837f14f77

The synthesizer uses a large inventory of diphone ""models"" to synthesize a desired phoneme string. The diphone inventory has been selected to differentiate between prevocalic and postvocalic allophones of sonorants, to account for changes in vowel color conditioned by postvocalic liquids, to allow exact specification of voice onset time, and to permit synthesis of glottal stops alveolar flaps and syllabic consonants. The diphones are extracted from carefully constructed short utterances and are stored as a sequence of LPC parameters. During synthesis, the requisite diphone models are time-warped, abutted and smoothed to produce a complete sequence of LPC parameters that are used in the synthesis.

"Two solution concepts for cooperative games in characteristic-function form, the kernel and the nucleolus, are studied in their relationship to a number of other concepts, most notably the core. The unifying technical idea is to analyze the behavior of the strong e-core as e varies. One of the central results is that the portion of the prekernel that falls within the core, or any other strong e-core, depends only on the latter's geometrical shape. The prekernel is closely related to the kernel and often coincides with it, but has a simpler definition and simpler analytic properties. A notion of “quasi-zero-monotonicity” is developed to aid in enlarging the class of games in which kernel considerations can be replaced by prekernel considerations. The nucleolus is approached through a new, geometrical definition, equivalent to Schmeidler's original definition but providing very elementary proofs of existence, unicity, and other properties. Finally, the intuitive interpretations of the two solution concepts are clarified: the kernel as a kind of multi-bilateral bargaining equilibrium without interpersonal utility comparisons, in which each pair of players bisects an interval which is either the battleground over which they can push each other aided by their best allies if they are strong or the no-man's-land that lies between them if they are weak; the nucleolus as the result of an arbitrator's desire to minimize the dissatisfaction of the most dissatisfied coalition.","['Michael Maschler', 'Bezalel Peleg', 'Lloyd S.

"The rising abuse of computers and increasing threat to personal privacy through data banks have stimulated much interest in the technical safeguards for data. There are four kinds of safeguards, each related to but distinct from the others. Access controls regulate which users may enter the system and subsequently which data sets an active user may read or write. Flow controls regulate the dissemination of values among the data sets accessible to a user. Inference controls protect statistical databases by preventing questioners from deducing confidential information by posing carefully designed sequences of statistical queries and correlating the responses. Statistical data banks are much less secure than most people believe. Data encryption attempts to prevent unauthorized disclosure of confidential information in transit or in storage.

"The mean-square errors (mse) of individual links of a communication network generally do not add up to the overall mse because of mutual correlations among the errors on the individual links. This makes it difficult to interpret the magnitude of contribution of each link to the mse. It is shown that if the mse of each link is defined alternatively as the mse between conditional mean estimators of the original signal at the input and output of that link, then the overall mse is in fact the sum of the mse's on individual links.

The unconditional failure time distribution is FG(f) = ∫F(t ∣ θ) dG(θ). In this paper we consider the estimation of G in reliability models when a priori information about the parameter θ is specified in the form of an initial guess, G0, of G. Utilizing the concepts of Dirichlet process priors on G, a Bayes estimate F̂G of FG may be obtained based on k observed lifetimes from FG. Then an estimate Ĝk of G is found from F̂G using a linear programming approach.

"Abstract#R##N##R##N#The subroutine call is one of the most fundamental of program control constructs. Despite this, it is rarely implemented at the job control or task level in existing commercially available software systems. When the feasibility of adding a general program calling mechanism to an existing system was investigated, it was apparent that there exist constraints on the amount of state information which could be saved on behalf of the calling program. A mechanism with low run-time overhead which saves a minimal amount of state information has proven to be easily integratable into a commercially available operating system. This mechanism has had a significant impact on the ease of development and support of large systems of programs. Examples of the use of the new calling mechanism include a program development system and a recursive directory manager for hierarchical directories.","['Douglas W. Jones', 'Arthur B.

"The problem of matching two images of the same scene, taken by different sensors under different viewing geometries, is a challenging problem in the field of image processing and pattern recognition. The scenes are usually transformed so drastically by the different viewing geometries and sensor characteristics that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to match the original images without the proper data processing. Geometric and intensity transformations must be performed to bring the matching elements and their intensity into a one-to-one correspondence. Objects of interest represented by subimages of one scene were located in the other using scene matching techniques with intensity difference and edge features as measurement features. Performance characteristics of the matches by these techniques are presented in terms of the probability of a match as a function of the probability of false fix.","['Robert Y. Wong', 'Ernest L.

The input device can read diagrams drawn on sheets of paper up to size A2 (40 × 55 cm).   Simple algorithms for discriminating between connection lines and gate symbols are also presented. These algorithms enable rapid processing of input data because there is no preliminary processing such as thinning or smoothing of lines.

The process assumes that certain information about the extension of the relations is known and uses that information to rename existing attributes and detect the need for additional attributes.

"In clinic practice, a series of transaxial views are usually obtained from a patient in the CAT scanner system. There are interests to present this data at different oblique views. Experience of implementing the generation programs shows the necessity to minimize its processing time in an on line environment. An orthogonal view generation program seems to be the best. This program allows user to specify an orthogonal cut in the displayed view interactively. The processing time for the specified cut is less than four minutes. A second subsequent cut can be drawn in the first generated cut. This orthogonal view generation program permits curvelinear cuts in the displayed view. This curvelinear cut provides a very untradirional dis play in radiology. It is useful in displaying a slice-sectional view of the spinal column of patients.

"One of the most salient difficulties facing the designer of a Natural Language Interface is the appropriate characterization of the semantics and pragmatics of new domains. Whereas various syntactic parsers have been developed which are largely domain-independent (at least in principle), the possibility of accomplishing something similar in the realm of semantics and pragmatics has never been convincingly demonstrated. Focusing on the various epistemological bases for associating attributes with entities, we examine some of the requirements that this suggests need be met by a system which claims to provide a domain-independent conceptual schema core, from which domain-specific extensions can be interactively elaborated. In addition to showing how our approach differs from one which tries to arrive at canonical representations in terms of invariant semantic primitives, we sketch out ways in which it can be integrated into a general parsing mechanism.","['Henry H.

"The algorithm presented in this paper is a direct approach to the problem of determining a linear discriminant function which minimizes total classification error in a two-class training set. Discriminant function coefficients are determined by a search technique which is based on two theorems derived from convexity theory. The number of iterative steps in the search sequence has a theoretical upper bound which is strictly less than the number required for full enumeration, and applications of the algorithm to experimental data have established its tractability under nontrivial conditions. Although the training set patterns are initially assumed to be in general position, this restriction is essentially eliminated by an extension of the algorithm which is briefly discussed.","['Ralph E.

"We introduce the property of k-decomposability for simplicial complexes which, if satisfied by the dual simplicial complex of a convex polyhedron, implies that the diameter of the polyhedron is bounded by a polynomial of degree k + 1 in the number of facets. These properties form a hierarchy, each one implying the next. The strongest, vertex decomposability, implies the Hirsch conjecture; the weakest is equivalent to shellability. We show that several cases in which the Hirsch conjecture has been verified can be handled by these methods, which also give the shellability of a number of simplicial complexes of combinatorial interest. We conclude with a strengthened form of the property of shellability which would imply the Hirsch conjecture for polytopes.","['J. Scott Provan', 'Louis J.

The proof also establishes a surprisingly small upper bound, namely n-2, on the minimal number of switchings required to derive G* from G.

"A user-oriented reliability model has been developed to measure the reliability of service that a system provides to a user community. It has been observed that in many systems, especially software systems, reliable service can be provided to a user when it is known that errors exist, provided that the service requested does not utilize the defective parts. The reliability of service, therefore, depends both on the reliability of the components and the probabilistic distribution of the utilization of the components to provide the service. In this paper, a user-oriented software reliability figure of merit is defined to measure the reliability of a software system with respect to a user environment. The effects of the user profile, which summarizes the characteristics of the users of a system, on system reliability are discussed. A simple Markov model is formulated to determine the reliability of a software system based on the reliability of each individual module and the measured intermodular transition probabilities as the user profile. Sensitivity analysis techniques are developed to determine modules most critical to system reliability.

"The asymptotic behavior of a Bayes optimal adaptive estimation scheme for a linear discrete-time dynamical system with unknown Markovian noise statistics is investigated. Noise influencing the state equation and the measurement equation is assumed to come from a group of Gaussian distributions having different means and covariances, with transitions from one noise source to another determined by a Markov transition matrix. The transition probability matrix is unknown and can take values only from a finite set. An example is simulated to illustrate the convergence.","['Jitendra K. Tugnait', 'Abraham H.

"This paper describes a prototype minicomputer interactive graphics system which has been developed for the capture, formatting and dissemination of electronics design information. The principal function of this system is to bring unification to the Design Automation activities at LLL, while incorporating human factors and modern tools into the electronics design process.   The Electronics Engineer's Design Station (hereafter referred to as the Design Station) is a minicomputer based system at which LLL's engineers and designers sketch in schematic designs. Once a circuit is formed at the graphics display, the pertinent design information is extracted and used to produce schematic drawings, parts lists, signal lists, parts and signal cross references and assembly drawings as well as inputs to simulators, automated layout tools and fabrication devices. Current fabrication technologies supported include both Wirewrap and Printed Circuit methodologies.   This system is designed to expedite the low volume, fast turnaround electronics designs which are typical of LLL's research projects. However, many of the concepts of this system address problems common throughout the electronics industry.   The Design Station is now being used on a regular basis by a small number of the design engineers at LLL. Initial indications are that the Design Station has increased the utilization of other DA tools at LLL as well as reducing the elapsed time, introduced errors and documentation costs for our one-of-a-kind designs.",['Dietz Bering'],1,"['0bcec783-3e03-4454-90a4-a9edeeea0444', '195ceb89-68e3-48e0-b498-fff1a67d2f99', '35efe532-5488-4d75-8b8f-df750e1bead1', 'd99a70f2-823e-4d13-b236-44209fbb16d6']",The Electronics Engineer's Design Station,design automation conference,1980,7106cb15-8391-40c9-8449-f6967380c35b

"A clear andpowerfulformalism for describing languages, both natural and artificial, follows fiom a method for expressing grammars in logic due to Colmerauer and Kowalski. This formalism, which is a natural extension of context-free grammars, we call ""definite clause grammars"" (DCGs). A DCG provides not only a description of a language, but also an effective means for analysing strings of that language, since the DCG, as it stands, is an executable program of the programming language Prolog. Using a standard Prolog compiler, the DCG can be compiled into efficient code, making it feasible to implement practical language analysers directly as DCGs. This paper compares DCGs with the successful and widely used augmented transition network (ATN) formalism, and indicates how ATNs can be translated into DCGs. It is argued that DCGs can be at least as efficient as ATNs, whilst the DCG formalism is clearer, more concise and in practice more powerful","['Fernando Pereira', 'David H. D.

"With rare exception, all presently available narrow-band speech coding systems implement scalar quantization (independent quantization) of the transmission parameters (such as reflection coefficients or transformed reflection coefficients in LPC systems). This paper presents a new approach called vector quantization. For very low data rates, realistic experiments have shown that vector quantization can achieve a given level of average distortion with 15 to 20 fewer bits/frame than that required for the optimized scalar quantizing approaches presently in use. The vector quantizing approach is shown to be a mathematically and computationally tractable method which builds upon knowledge obtained in linear prediction analysis studies.

"Abstract#R##N##R##N#This paper investigates the ways and uses of permitting a variable number of routine parameters in typed high-level languages. The problem is first introduced through the notions: optional parameters, multiple parameters and polymorphic parameters. The optional parameter mechanism is motivated by the advantages of the conventional practice of omitting certain actual parameters in routine calls as permitted in some low-level languages. The multiple parameter mechanism facilitates restructuring of routine definitions so that multiple calls to the same routine can be replaced by a single call. The polymorphic parameter mechanism permits routine definitions which can operate on different types of data. These three notions together provide a powerful means of permitting a variable number of parameters in typed languages. The power of the mechanism is illustrated by a specific application: if such a mechanism is introduced in Pascal, the language definition can be completely freed from the need for predefining files and the standard input/output routines, at the same time retaining most of its programming convenience.",['V.

"Abstract : How can we insure that knowledge embedded in a program is applied effectively? Traditionally the answer to this question has been sought in different problem solving paradigms and in different approaches to encoding and indexing knowledge. Each of these is useful with a certain variety of problem, but they all share a common problem: they become ineffective in the face of a sufficiently large knowledge base. How then can we make it possible for a system to continue to function in the face of a very large number of plausibly useful chunks of knowledge? In response to this question we propose a framework for viewing issues of knowledge indexing and retrieval, a framework that includes what appears to be a useful perspective on the concept of a strategy. We view strategies as a means of controlling invocation in situations where traditional selection mechanisms become ineffective. We examine ways to effect such control, and describe meta-rules, a means of specifying strategies which offers a number of advantages. We consider at some length how and when it is useful to reason about control, and explore the advantages meta-rules offer for doing this.

"The language of scene descriptions must allow a hearer to build structures of schemas similar (to some level of detail) to those the speaker has built via perceptual processes. The understanding process in general requires a hearer to create and run  ""event simulations""  to check the consistency and plausibility of a ""picture"" constructed from a speaker's description. A speaker must also run similar event simulations on his own descriptions in order to be able to judge when the hearer has been given sufficient information to construct an appropriate ""picture"", and to be able to respond appropriately to the hearer's questions about or responses to the scene description.In this paper I explore some simple scene description examples in which a hearer must make judgements involving reasoning about scenes, space, common-sense physics, cause-effect relationships, etc. While I propose some mechanisms for dealing with such scene descriptions, my primary concern at this time is to flesh out our understanding of just what the mechanisms must accomplish: what information will be available to them and what information must be found or generated to account for the inferences we know are actually made.",['David L.

"Abstract : Minimizing the area of a circuit is an important problem in the domain of Very Large Scale Integration. We use a theoretical VLSI model to reduce this problem to one of laying out a graph, where the transistors and wires of the circuit are identified with the vertices and edges of the graph. We give an algorithm that produces VLSI layouts for classes of graphs that have good separator theorems. We show in particular that any planar graph of n vertices has an O(n lg-square(n)) area layout and that any tree of n vertices can be laid out in linear area. The algorithm maintains a sparse representation for layouts that is based on the well-known UNION-FIND data structure, and as a result, the running time devoted to management of this representation is nearly linear.

"Cohorts of youths sentenced to a variety of correctional programs show substantial reductions in delinquent activity after leaving the programs compared to before sentencing. This paper develops models of delinquent activity and subsequent sentencing to a correctional program. We show how a population of youths, whose delinquent activity is represented by a stationary stochastic process, can be selected (using reasonable selection rules) to form a cohort which has an inflated rate of delinquent activity prior to selection. When the activity rate returns to its uninflated rate after the youths are released from the program, an apparent reduction results. Based on this analysis we conclude that the reductions noted in delinquent activity may be largely due to the way delinquents are selected for correction rather than to the effect of the programs.","['Michael D.

"Accompanying the rapid development of integrated circuit fabrication technology has been a parallel, but slower, development of IC design techniques and systems. Recent approaches to IC design enable individual designers to consider developing their own VLSI circuits. Such capability may open the door to a more varied set of system designs than could previously be considered in most design environments.   The panel members are all currently designing graphic systems oriented towards VLSI implementation. Each will give a short presentation describing one of their system designs. Following these presentations, three members of the previous session (Forest Baskett, Andreas Bechtolsheim, and Fred Parke) will discuss common issues, problems, and future prospects.","['Henry Fuchs', 'Dan Cohen', 'Bob Sproull', 'James H.

"This paper, which was initially prepared to accompany a series of lectures given at the 1978 NATO International Summer School on Program Construction, is primarily tutorial in nature. It begins by discussing in a general setting the role of type abstraction and the need for formal specifications of type abstractions. It then proceeds to examine in some detail two approaches to the construction of such specifications: that proposed by Hoare in his 1972 paper ""Proofs of Correctness of Data Representations,"" and the author's own version of algebraic specifications. The Hoare approach is presented via a discussion of its embodiment in the programming language Euclid. The discussion of the algebraic approach includes material abstracted from earlier papers as well as some new material that has yet to appear. This new material deals with parameterized types and the specification of restrictions. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the relative merits of the two approaches to type abstraction.",['John V.

"The problem of daily controlling a water distribution network, including pumping devices and storage capacities, in order to supply the consumers at the lowest cost is formulated as a constrained optimal control problem. Discrete Dynamic Programming seems the only way to overcome the particular difficulties of this problem but the dimensionality prevents one using it on the global problem. Two approaches are considered. The first one consists in tearing up the network into several subnetworks and to use an algorithm of coordination. It succeeds in case of weak coupling between subnetworks. The second one uses an original approach of aggregation and disaggregation iteratively. Presently available experiments with the latter method showed its satisfactory behaviour.","['Gérald Joalland', 'Guy Cohen']",0,[],Brief Paper: Optimal control of a water distribution network by two multilevel methods,Automatica,1980,a6c7dfc3-12f4-4e62-9ca1-f083b31815ff

"Microcode compaction is an essential tool for the compilation of high-level language microprograms into microinstructions with parallel microoperations. Although guaranteeing minimum execution time is an exponentially complex problem, recent research indicates that it is not difficult to obtain practical results. This paper, which assumes no prior knowledge of microprogramming on the part of the reader, surveys the approaches that have been developed for compacting microcode. A comprehensive terminology for the area is presented, as well as a general model of processor behavior suitable for comparing the algorithms. Execution examples and a discussion of strengths and weaknesses are given for each of the four classes of loc .al compaction algorithms: linear, critical path, branch and bound, and list scheduling. Local compaction, which applies to jump-free code, is fundamental to any compaction technique.

"The SCREEN system is an experimental tool for development and maintenance of application software. It is organized as a System of Communicating REsidential ENvironments, where each environment may be e.g. a programming environment or an end-user environment. Environments are able to send and receive modules which contain programs and data, and the maintenance of an application (throughout the software life-cycle) is performed by communicating such modules. Each programming environment may send several modules to each of several end-user environments, to account for specialized user needs, as well as updates of those modules.   End-user environments consist of a fixed framework, into which contributed modules can plug in. The framework is designed specifically for each class of applications, and can be viewed as a special-purpose operating system for that class of applications. The organizational principles used in the SCREEN system are an extension of the residential programming systems that have been developed for Lisp, but they have an increased emphasis on software engineering issues. They represent an alternative to the classical principles for the production and use of software, which are based on the use of compilers, linkage editors, and general-purpose operating systems.","['Erik Sandewall', 'Henrik Sörensen', 'Claes Strömberg']",50,"['1da68903-4d25-456b-b9f8-667678827f2e', '49bfde1f-c800-4492-9850-88b8b1ec6a6d']",A System of Communicating Residential Environments,international conference on functional programming,1980,e0ffa3c3-9e32-4fed-bce3-0a9ca24c61be

"This paper presents a model of an I/O subsystem in which devices can be accessed from multiple CPUs and/or via alternative channel and control unit paths. The model estimates access response times, given access rates for all CPU-device combinations. The systems treated are those having the IBM System/370 architecture, with each path consisting of a CPU, channel, control unit, head of string, and device with rotational position sensing. The path selected for an access at seek initiation time remains in effect for the entire channel program.   The computation proceeds in three stages: First, the feasibility of the prescribed access rates is determined by solving a linear programming problem. Second, the splitting of access rates among the available paths is determined so as to satisfy the following principle:   The probability of selecting a given path is proportional to the probability that the path is free.   This condition leads to a set of nonlinear equations, which can be solved by means of the Newton-Raphson method.   Third, the RPS hit probability, i.e. the probability that the path is free when the device is ready to transmit, is computed in the following manner: From the point of view of the selected path, the system may be viewed as being in one of 25 possible states. There are twelve different subsets of states whose aggregate probabilities can be computed from the (by now) known flow rates over the various paths. The maximum entropy principle is used to calculate the unknown state probabilities, with the known aggregate probabilities acting as constraints. The required RPS hit probability can be computed easily once the state probabilities have been determined. Explicit formulas are given for all these quantities. Empirically derived formulas are used to compute the RPS miss probability on subsequent revolutions, given the probability on the first revolution.   The model is validated against a simulator, showing excellent agreement for systems with path utilizations up to 50 percent. The model is also validated against measurements from a real three-CPU system with 31 shared devices. In this validation, the I/O subsystem model acts as a common submodel to three copies of a system model, one for each CPU. Estimated end-user transaction response times show excellent agreement with the live measurements.",['Yonathan Bard'],53,,A model of shared dasd and multipathing,"international symposium on computer modeling, measurement and evaluation",1980,5b4cf6ca-4019-4a7f-86ca-38ce74186969

"This paper presents the design of the Distributed Double-Loop Computer Network (DDLCN), which is a local-area distributed computing system that interconnects midi, mini and micro computers using a fault-tolerant double-loop network. Several new features and novel concepts have been incorporated into the design of its subsystems, viz., the reliable communication network, the programming/operating system (P/OS), and the distributed loop data base system (DLDBS). The interface design is unique in that it employs tri-state control logic and bit-sliced processing, thereby enabling the network to become dynamically reconfigurable and fault tolerant with respect to communication link failure as well as component failure in the interface. Three classes of multi-destination communication protocols, each providing a different degree of reliability, have been incorporated into the network to facilitate efficient and reliable exchanges of messages.   The P/OS is distinguished from other similar research efforts in that its ultimate goal is to support not only communication and cooperation among autonomous, distributed processes running at various nodes, but also to support convenient and correct resource sharing through program generation (semi-automatic programming) for application and systems programmers. A new concurrency control mechanism for DLDBS has been developed, which uses distributed control without global locking and is deadlock free.

"A new technique for design of digital filters is presented in this paper. The technique consists of splitting the given log magnitude response into two parts, one corresponding to the response of the numerator polynomial of the filter transfer function and the other part to the response of the denominator polynomial. The inverse of each of these polynomials is considered as an all-pole filter and the response of the all-pole filter is approximated by a small number of autoregressive coefficients. The autoregressive coefficients obtained for the numerator polynomial represent the zero part of the final filter and the coefficients obtained for the denominator polynomial represent the pole part of the final filter. With equal number of poles and zeros, the overall filter response can be made nearly equiripple in the passband and stopband. The amplitude of the ripple can be traded with the width of the transition band. The ripple characterstics can be controlled by appropriately choosing the number of poles and zeros of the filter.",['B.

"This paper investigates how database systems would be designed and used under the limiting-case assumption that mass storage is free. It is argued that free mass storage would free database systems from the limitations and problems caused by conventional deletion techniques. A non-deletion strategy would significantly simplify database systems and their operation, as well as increase their functionality and availability. Consideration of this limiting case helps shed light on a more realistic argument: if the cost of mass storage were low enough, then deletion would become undesirable.   It is also argued that the often labor-intensive costs and time delays involved in archival and retrieval of older data can be minimized if a single technology were available with low-cost on-line storage and a low-cost archival media with long shelf life.   Optical discs promise to come one to two orders of magnitude closer to the limiting case of free mass storage than ever before. Other features of optical discs include improved reliability and a single technology for both on-line and archival storage with a long shelf life. Because of these features and because of (not in spite of) their non-deletion limitation, it is argued that optical discs fit the requirements of database systems better than magnetic discs and tapes.",['George P.

"It is shown that if f is a nonexpansive piecewise-linear mapping of Rm into itself, there exists a unique half-line that f maps into itself and such that restriction of f thereto is a translation. One easy consequence of this result is that there exists a unique m-vector α such that for every m-vector x, the sequence fnx-nα remains bounded. In particular, fnx/n converges to the same limit α, for all x. Also, f has a fixed point if and only if α = 0.

"An alternative representation to the usual outline description of geometric entities for IC mask artwork is described. Rather than identifying opaque areas of a mask by individual shape outlines as described by their corners' coordinates, both the opaque and transparent areas of the design are represented by 1' s and 0's respectively in a grid pattern or “bit map” of the entire mask plane.   A bit-map representation is well suited to many computer design aids which deal with IC layout data. Artwork output programs which require a “MERGE” operation on all shapes of each mask benefit from this data format since it already contains the merged version of each mask's geometric entities. The bit-map format especially promises to increase the operational efficiency of Boolean comparisons of various mask levels as performed by artwork analysis programs for locating design rule errors and for identifying circuit elements directly from the masks.   A hierarchical scheme for describing the bit patterns of a mask efficiently is presented which limits the memory requirements of this data format to a size proportional to the usual outline description. Consequently the bit-map representation can be used not only in those computer aids where it supports program functions very well, but also as the central data format for a CAD system.",['James A.

These arrays can be used as alternative character representations for use on devices with gray scale capability. Discussed in this paper are both the filtering algorithms that are used to generate gray scale fonts and some consequences of using gray levels for the representation of fonts including:   1. The apparent resolution of the display is increased when using gray scale fonts allowing smaller fonts to be used with higher apparent positional accuracy and readability. This is especially important when using low resolution displays.   2. Fonts of any size and orientation can be generated automatically from suitable high precision representations.

"The idea of declaring a reward (punishment) for a decision maker according to his particular choice of action in order to induce certain ""desired"" behavior on the part of the decision maker is known as incentive (threat). This practice is age old. However, only in recent years have the notions been formalized. In the development of a control-theoretic view on incentives, we first investigate the deterministic version of the incentive problem. This reveals the basic simple idea behind the problem. It also illustrates the different possibilities introduced by the presence of dynamics and multi-follower nature of the problem. This is followed by two variants of the stochastic version of the problem where we concentrate on the role of uncertainties. Relationship to economic literature is also discussed.","['Yu-Chi Ho', 'Peter B.

"Color-And-Weave is the use of both light and dark threads in both warp and weft in a handweaving. Traditional weaves such as twill, point twill, summer and winter, and shadow weave produce many unusual attractive handweaving patterns with Color-And-Weave that cannot be produced without it. The process of weaving these new patterns is interesting and not unduly complex in most cases of importance. The design of these patterns using paper-and-pencil drafting techniques is admittedly infeasibly difficult. However, this problem has been resolved by the use of an inexpensive microcomputer graphics system. In a forthcoming book [1], the authors present the main results of an extensive computer study of Color-And-Weave effects including complete drafts and woven samples for 700-800 nontraditional handweaving patterns. In this paper, we shall present a theoretical approach to Color-And-Weave and discuss the ramifications in the case of the simplest woven structure; namely, Plain Weave. In a companion paper [2], additional details are given on (i) the computer study of hand weaving patterns that was conducted and (ii) the microcomputer system that was used.","['M. B.

Both decision procedures determine the satisfiability of a conjunction of literals of length  n  in average time  O ( n  log  n ) using the fastest known congruence closure algorithm. It is also shown that if the axiomatization of the theory of list structure is changed slightly, the problem of determining the satisfiability of a conjunction of literals becomes NP-complete.

"The problem addressed here concerns a set of isolated processors, some unknown subset of which may be faulty, that communicate only by means of two-party messages. Each nonfaulty processor has a private value of information that must be communicated to each other nonfaulty processor. Nonfaulty processors always communicate honestly, whereas faulty processors may lie. The problem is to devise an algorithm in which processors communicate their own values and relay values received from others that allows each nonfaulty processor to infer a value for each other processor. The value inferred for a nonfaulty processor must be that processor's private value, and the value inferred for a faulty one must be consistent with the corresponding value inferred by each other nonfaulty processor.  It is shown that the problem is solvable for, and only for,  n  ≥ 3 m  + 1, where  m  is the number of faulty processors and  n  is the total number. It is also shown that if faulty processors can refuse to pass on information but cannot falsely relay information, the problem is solvable for arbitrary  n  ≥  m  ≥ 0.

Some recent work (1) has shown how one can compute limited portions of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a long sequence by first passing it through a decimating FIR filter and then using the FFT algorithm on the result. The filter is designed by an easily available program (2) to put a pass-band at the desired frequencies and stop-bands at all frequencies which will be aliased into the pass-band by the decimation. It is shown here how one may relax the constraints put upon the pass-band of the filter and significantly shorten the filter impulse response with a corresponding reduction in the amount of computation. A second innovation is to show how a set of cascaded decimating filters may be designed which requires less arithmetic and storage than a single large decimating filter. This reduction is achieved by designing each cascaded filter so as to take into account the attenuation of the preceding filters.,"['James W.

This paper describes a parallel high speed multiprocessor architecture suitable for realizing a 512×512 point 2-D FFT in under 1/30 of a second; enabling real time video display processing. The hardware employs a constant geometry algorithm for the implementation and utilizes 16 butterfly processors. The machine can be described as a Multiple Instruction Multiple Data (MIMD) type of machine since 16 processors will be working on 16 sets of data simultaneously. The memory organization is modular in design and provides conflict-free access to all 16 processors at all times. The memory can be interfaced to a host computer which can do other nonreal time picture processing operations on the transformed image.,"['C. S. Joshi', 'John F. McDonald', 'Randy H.

"A method for adaptive linear estimation is proposed based on a Time Domain Orthogonality condition. This algorithm arises naturally from the criterion used rather than through the application of a numerical analysis method as in the derivation of the LMS Gradient Algorithm. However, in addition to being a new and potentially useful algorithm, the resulting recursive method is suprisingly similar to the LMS Gradient Algorithm. With the addition of certain simplifying assumptions, the TDO algorithm reduces to the LPIS Gradient Algorithm except that a data dependent term replaces the constant parameter µ found In the LMS Gradient Method. In fact, it is shown that this data dependent term is an estimate of the optimum µ for maximum rate of convergence.","['Stephen D. Huffman', 'Loren W.

"The problem addressed in this paper is the selection of the shortest path through a directed, acyclic network where the arc lengths are independent random variables. This problem has received little attention although the deterministic version of the problem has been studied extensively. The concept of a path optimality index is introduced as a performance measure for selecting a path of a stochastic network. A path optimality index is defined as the probability a given path is shorter than all other network paths. This paper presents an analytic derivation of path optimality indices for directed, acyclic networks. A new network concept, Uniformly Directed Cutsets (UDCs), is introduced. UDCs are shown to be important to the efficient implementation of the prescribed analytic procedure.

"Abstract   Let  F  a two-alternative voting rule and  G   F   the subgroup of permutations of the voters under which  F  is invariant. Group theoretic properties of  G   F   provide information about the voting rule  F . In particular, sets of imprimitivity of  G   F   describe the ‘committee decomposition’ structure of  F  and permutation group transitivity of  G   F   (equipotency) is shown to be closely connected with equal distribution of power among the voters. If equipotency replaces anonymity in the hypotheses of May's theorem, voting rules other than simple majority are possible. By combining equipotency with two additional social choice conditions a new characterization of simple majority rule is obtained. Equipotency is proposed as an important alternative to the more restrictive anonymity as a fairness criterion in social choice.",['Edward W.

This paper deals with the application of tree and trellis coding concepts to the coding of stationary first-order auto-regressive sources and speech signals at a rate of 1 bit/sample. We show first that a probabilistically generated tree (or trellis) performs significantly better than a tree (or trellis) that is generated in a deterministic way. We show then that the segmental signal-to-noise-ratios of conventional speech coding schemes (including) those with adaptive quantization and/or prediction) can be increased by about 2 dB. Slightly higher values of 3 to 4 dB have been realized with schemes which employ backward-adaptive quantization.,"['Heinz G.

"Policy function schedulers provide a flexible framework for implementing a wide range of different scheduling schemes. In such schedulers, the priority of a job at any instant in time is defined by the difference between the time it spent in the system and an arbitrary function of its attained service time. The latter is called the policy function and acts as the functional parameter that specifies a particular scheduling scheme. For instance, a constant policy function specifies the first-come, first-serve scheduling scheme. By changing the policy function, the system behavior can be adjusted to better conform with desired response characteristics. It is common to express response characteristics in terms of a response function, the average response time of a job conditioned on its service requirement in equilibrium.   In this paper, we analyze processor-sharing M/G/1 systems in which the priorities of different classes of jobs are determined by distinct policy functions.",['Manfred Ruschitzka'],0,,The response of job classes with distinct policy functions(Extended Abstract),"international symposium on computer modeling, measurement and evaluation",1980,6f10bc6a-f0a7-47d4-b71b-7b1914954945

"Very high level languages for describing mechanical assembly require a representation of the geometric and physical properties of 3-D objects including parts, tools, and the assembler itself. This paper describes a geometric modeling system that generates a data base in which objects and assemblies are represented by nodes in a graph structure. The edges of the graph represent relationships among objects such as part-of, attachment, constraint, and assembly. The nodes also store positional relationships between objects and physical properties such as material type. The user designs objects by combining positive and negative parameterized primitive volumes, for example, cubes and cones, which are represented internally as polyhedra. The data base is built by invoking a procedural representation of the primitive volumes, which generates vertex, edge, and surface lists of instances of the volumes. Several applications in the automatic assembly domain have been implemented using the geometric modeling system as a basis.","['Michael A. Wesley', 'Tomas Lozano-Perez', 'Lawrence I.

"We shall consider the optimal replacement of a unit which is subject to random failure. It is assumed that there exists a hazard rate process rt, adapted to the history of the unit and, for a fixed t, denoting the conditional probability density of failure at t, given that the unit has not failed until t. If the unit is functioning at t, it can be replaced by a new one and a random replacement cost ct depending on the history of the unit up to t is incurred. If the unit fails at t, then it is replaced, and in addition to the replacement cost, a failure cost Kt, depending on the history of the unit, is incurred. The optimality criterion is the minimization of the total long run average cost per unit time. Our model generalizes the model of Bergman Bergman, B. 1978. Optimal replacement under a general failure model. Adv. Appl. Probab.10 431--444. by allowing the state-dependence of the replacement and failure costs. The main result of the present paper states that there exists an optimal replacement rule, and that it is a threshold rule for the process γt = dct/dt + Ktrt. This means that there exists a* < ∞, such that an optimal replacement rule is to replace at the time when the process rt assumed to be nondecreasing reaches the level a*, or if failure occurs before this, to replace at failure.

"Abstract#R##N#The genomes of numerous avian retroviruses contain at their 3' termini a conserved domain denoted ""c"". The precise boundaries and function of ""c"" have been enigmas. In an effort to resolve these issues, we determined the sequence of over 900 nucleotides at the 3' end of the genome of the Schmidt-Ruppin subgroup A strain of avian sarcoma virus (ASV). We obtained the sequence from a suitable fragment of ASV DNA that had cloned into the single-stranded DNA phage M13mp2. Computer-assisted analysis of the sequence revealed the following structural features: i) the length of ""c"" - 473 nucleotides; ii) the 3' terminal domain of src, ending in an amber codon at the 5'boundary of ""c""; iii) terminator codons that preclude continuous translation from ""c""; iv) suitably located sequences that may serve as signals for the initiation of viral RNA synthesis and for the processing and/or polyadenylation of viral mRNA; v) a repeated sequence that flanks src and that could facilitate deletion of this gene; vi) repeated sequences within ""c""; and vii) unexplained homologies between sequences in ""c"" and sequences in several other nucleic acids, including the 5' terminal domain of the ASV genome, tRNATrp and its inversion, the complement of tRNATrp and its inversion, and the 18S RNA of eukaryotic ribosomes.

"A study was performed to evaluate various techniques for improving the robustness of an Adaptive Predictive Coder operating in the presence of channel errors. The communications environment consisted of a packetized, symbol oriented system in which channel errors were manifested as both 5-bit symbol errors in the received bit stream and the occasional loss of an entire packet of data. To reduce the effects of symbol errors forward error correction was applied to a selected subset of the transmitted parameter bits. At the receiver, smoothing strategies were employed to replace those parameters in which errors could be detected but not corrected and to cope with situations in which entire packets were lost. The introduction of these techniques to the basic APC vocoder added 900-1100 bps to the bit rate and resulted in significantly improved robustness in channel errors.",['Elliot Singer'],50,[],Techniques for improving the robustness of an adaptive predictive coder in the presence of channel errors,"international conference on acoustics, speech, and signal processing",1980,cb39c6dd-ffd6-4d6d-b676-56109af47b14
"Under what circumstances can finite difference approximations serve as substitutes for analytical derivatives in unconstrained optimization? Are such techniques as good as using derivative-free methods? We investigated these two questions via both theoretical analysis and the solution of 15 test problems on the computer. It was discovered as expected that the error in the derivative substitutes influences algorithm performance only near termination, and that simple difference formulas are more efficient than more complex ones if the step size is selected properly. Among all the algorithms tested, the Davidon algorithm was the best both for the class using analytical derivatives and for the class with finite difference substitutes. Derivative-free algorithms were not as efficient.","['D. M.

"This paper describes the design goals, micro- architecture, and implementation of the microprogrammed processor for a compact high performance personal computer. This computer supports a range of high level language environments and high bandwidth I/O devices. Besides the processor, it has a cache, a memory map, main storage, and an instruction fetch unit; these are described in other papers. The processor can be shared among 16 microcoded tasks, performing microcode context switches on demand with essentially no overhead. Conditional branches are done without any lookahead or delay. Microinstructions are fairly tightly encoded, and use an interesting variant on control field sharing. The processor implements a large number of internal registers, hardware stacks, a cyclic shifter/masker, and an arithmetic/logic unit, together with external data paths for instruction fetching, memory interface, and I/O, in a compact, pipe-lined organization.       The machine has a 50 ns microcycle, and can execute a simple macroinstruction in one cycle; the available I/O bandwidth is 640 Mbits/sec. The entire machine, including disk, display and network interfaces, is implemented with approximately 3000 MSI components, mostly ECL 10K; the processor is about 35% of this. In addition there are up to 4 storage modules, each with about 300 16K or 64K RAMS and 200 MSI components, for a total of 8 Mbytes. Several prototypes are currently running.","['Butler W.

"Abstract   Simulation, particularly of networks of queues, is an application with a high degree of inherent parallelism, and is of considerable practical interest. We continue the analysis of synchronization methods for distributed simulation, defined by the taxonomy in our previous paper. Specifically, we develop algorithms for time-driven simulation using a network of processors. For most of the synchronization methods considered, each node k of an n-node network simulation cannot proceed directly with its part of a simulation. Rather, it must compute some function  B   k  ( ν  1 ,  ν  2 , …,  ν   n  ), where  ν   i   is some value which must be obtained from node  i . The value of  ν   i   at each node changes as the simulation progresses, and must be broadcast to every other node for the recomputation of the  B -functions. In some cases, it is advantageous to compute the  B -function in a distributed manner. Broadcast algorithms for such distributed computation are presented. Since the performance of a broadcast algorithm depends on the properties of the inter-process communication facility, we characterize some particular cases and give algorithms for each of them.","['J.

A synchronization method for distributed DBS is presented which guarantees synchronization of transactions according to the principle of serializability. No exclusive locks are used. Read requests can always be granted without being delayed or blocked by updates of other transactions; delays at most arise from communication between different nodes of the distributed system. Read only transactions are never backed up. The described method is applicable to distributed DBS without copies as well as to DBS with any number of copies of arbitrary objects.

"This paper is an attempt at laying the foundations for the classification of queries on relational data bases according to their structure and their computational complexity. Using the operations of composition and fixpoints, a Σ-Π hierarchy of height, ω2, called the fixpoint query hierarchy, is defined, and its properties investigated. The hierarchy includes most of the queries considered in the literature including those of Codd and Aho and Ullman. The hierarchy to level ω characterizes the first-order queries, and the levels up to ω are shown to be strict. Sets of queries larger than the fixpoint query hierarchy are obtained by considering the queries computable in polynomial time, queries computable in polynomial space, etc. It is shown that classes of queries defined from such complexity classes behave (with respect to containment) in a manner very similar to the corresponding complexity classes. Also, the set of second-order queries turns out to be the same as the set of queries defined from the polynomialtime hierarchy. Finally, these classes of queries are used to characterize a set of queries defined from language considerations: those expressible in a programming language with only typed (or ranked) relation variables.

"Several new properties as well as simplified proofs of known properties are developed for the mutual information rate between discrete-time random processes whose alphabets are Borel subsets of complete separable metric spaces. In particular, the asymptotic properties of quantizers for such spaces provide a fink with finite-alphabet processes and yield the ergodic decomposition of mutual information rate. This result is used to prove the equality of stationary and ergodic process distortion-rate functions with the usual distortion-rate function. An unusual definition of mutual information rate for continuous-alphabet processes is used, but it is shown to be operationally appropriate and more useful mathematically; it provides an intuitive link between continuous-alphabet and finite-alphabet processes, and it allows generalizations of some fundamental results of ergodic theory that are useful for information theory.","['Robert M.

The B-spline surface is manipulated by its associated polygonal net. Both surface and net are three-dimensional. Techniques both good and bad for 3-D picking of a polygon point when the net, its associated surface, and the 3-D picking cue independently exist and can be independently manipulated in three space are presented and discussed.   The shape of a B-spline surface of fixed order is controlled by the location of the polygon net points, the number of multiple points at a particular net point, and the knot vector. Frequently multiple points imply multiple knot vectors. Practical techniques for controlling and shaping the surface with and without this assumption are discussed and the results illustrated.   Experience attained by interactively fitting a single fourth order B-spline surface patch to the forebody half of an actual ship hull described by three dimensional digitized points is discussed and the results illustrated.","['David F.

"Methods for the automatic construction of error handling parsers are presented. The resulting parsers are capable of correcting all syntax errors by insertion and/or deletion of terminal symbols to the right of the error location. Thus, the output of the parser always corresponds to a syntactically valid program. This contributes significantly to the reliability and robustness of a compiler. The speed of parsing correct parts of a program is not affected by the presence of the error handling capability. The correction algorithm is easy to implement. Apart from the parsing tables only one character per parser state is required to control the correction process. The method is applicable to a wide class of stack automata including LL(k), LR(k), SLR(k), and LALR(k) parsers. It is shown that for LL(k) grammars error correction can be obtained as a byproduct of the canonical LL(k) parser generation. A similar result can be obtained for LR(k) grammars if the parser generator is slightly modified. The method has been successfully added to an LALR(1) parser generator.",['Johannes Röhrich'],50,"['1bfa8811-7ed4-4bb5-a6fd-41a35b4f9021', '29342bcc-2777-4fdf-9d21-75e0c117b302', '49bfeb1a-86a1-4855-bf42-edacb81f5cff', 'c27746ca-6c35-4fd3-9c06-59e6974043d1']",Methods for the automatic construction of error correcting parsers,Acta Informatica,1980,5e7f1128-5d83-46c6-af0a-1a519471a00c

"An evaluation of the ability of four texture analysis algorithms to perform automatic texture discrimination will be described. The algorithms which will be examined are the spatial gray level dependence method (SGLDM), the gray level run length method (GLRLM), the gray level difference method (GLDM), and the power spectral method (PSM). The evaluation procedure employed does not depend on the set of features used with each algorithm or the pattern recognition scheme. Rather, what is examined is the amount of texturecontext information contained in the spatial gray level dependence matrices, the gray level run length matrices, the gray level difference density functions, and the power spectrum. The comparison will be performed in two steps. First, only Markov generated textures will be considered. The Markov textures employed are similar to the ones used by perceptual psychologist B. Julesz in his investigations of human texture perception. These Markov textures provide a convenient mechanism for generating certain example texture pairs which are important in the analysis process. In the second part of the analysis the results obtained by considering only Markov textures will be extended to all textures which can be represented by translation stationary random fields of order two. This generalization clearly includes a much broader class of textures than Markovian ones. The results obtained indicate that the SGLDM is the most powerful algorithm of the four considered, and that the GLDM is more powerful than the PSM.","['Richard W. Conners', 'Charles A.

"A fundamental problem of cyclic staffing is to size and schedule a minimum-cost workforce so that sufficient workers are on duty during each time period. This may be modeled as an integer linear program with a cyclically structured 0-1 constraint matrix. We identify a large class of such problems for which special structure permits the ILP to be solved parametrically as a bounded series of network flow problems. Moreover, an alternative solution technique is shown in which the continuous-valued LP is solved, and the result rounded in a special way to yield an optimum solution to the ILP.","['John J.

"We consider two simple models of overhead in batch computer systems and demand access communications systems. The first, termed “modified M/M/1/K, ” is an exponential, single-server queuing system with finite storage capacity, constant arrival rate, and queue-length-dependent service time. We consider cases in which the expected service time consists of a constant plus a term that grows linearly or logarithmically with the queue length. We show that the performance of this system—as characterized by the expected number of customers in the system, the expected time in the system, and the rate of missed customers—can collapse as the result of small changes in the arrival rate, the overhead rate, or the queue capacity. The system has the interesting property that increasing the queue capacity can decrease performance. In addition to equilibrium results, we consider the dynamic behavior of the model. We show that the system tends to operate in either of two quasi-stable modes of operation—one with low queue lengths and one with high queue lengths. System behavior is characterized by long periods of operation in both modes with abrupt transitions between them. We point out that the performance of a saturated system may be improved by dynamic operating procedures that return the system to the low mode.   In the second model, termed the “lazy repairman, ” the single server has two distinct states: the “busy” state and the “lazy” state. Customers receive service only when the server is in the busy state; overhead is modeled by attributing time spent in the lazy state to overhead functions. When the expected time spent in the lazy state increases with the number of customers waiting for service, the behavior of the lazy repairman model is similar to the modified M/M/1/K, although the lazy repairman model makes it easier to study in detail the effects of overhead.",['John E.

All studies of computing in social life make important assumptions about the social world in which computing is embedded. Two broad perspectives are contrasted. Systems rationalism, a collection of approaches including management science, managerial rationalism, and the systems approach, is found to be most helpful in stable settings, when there is considerable consensus over important social values.

"Abstract   The purpose of this research is to investigate the extent to which knowledge can replace and support search in selecting a chess move and to delineate the issues involved. This has been carried out by constructing a program, PARADISE (PAttern Recognition Applied to DIrecting SEarch), which finds the best move in tactically sharp middle game positions from the games of chess masters. It encodes a large body of knowledge in the form of production rules. The actions of the rules post concepts in the data base while the conditions match patterns in the chess position and data base. The program uses the knowledge base to discover plans during static analysis and to guide a small tree search which confirms that a particular plan is best. The search is “small” in the sense that the size of the search tree is of the same order of magnitude as a human master's search tree (tens and hundreds of nodes, not thousands to hundreds of thousands as in many computer chess programs).  Once a plan is formulated, it guides the tree search for several ply and expensive static analyses (needed to analyze a new position) are done infrequently. PARADISE avoids placing a depth limit on the search (or any other artificial effort limit). By using a global view of the search tree, information gathered during the search, and the analysis provided by the knowledge base, the program produces enough terminations to force convergence of the search. PARADISE has found combinations as deep as 19 ply.",['David E.

"This paper presents a scheme for encoding the output bits of an 8500 bps residual excited linear predictive coder (RELPC), in which the quality of the synthesized speech is more sensitive to errors in certain bits. Fifty-two of the 272 bits in a 32 ms voice frame were identified as most critical and in need of protection. A Burst-trapping code, using a (21,14) Single Error Correcting Double Error Detecting shortened Cyclic Hamming code as the basic block code was constructed. The code was selected with due consideration to computational load, delay in decoding and total bit rate requirement of less than 9.6 kbs. The paper also describes a Markov model for the decoding process and then determines the improvement in quality resulting from the use of the above scheme. In particular a bit error rate of 5 × 10 3 is reduced to 3 × 10 6 and a burst error rate of 5 × 10 4 is reduced to 6.8 × 10 5 .

"Let ( E , (rho)) be a polymatroid with a ground set E and a rank function (rho). A base x = ( x ( e )) (epsilon) (in) E of polymatroid ( E , (rho)) is called a lexicographically optimal base of ( E , (rho)) with respect to a weight vector w = ( w ( e )) (epsilon)(in) E if the | E |-tuple of the numbers x ( e )/ w ( e )( e (in) E ) arranged in order of increasing magnitude is lexicographically maximum among all | E |-tuples of numbers y ( e )/ w ( e )( e (in) E ) arranged in the same manner for all bases y = ( y ( e )) e (in) E of ( E , (rho)). We give theorems that characterize the relationship between weight vectors and lexicographically optimal bases and point out that a lexicographically optimal base minimizes among all bases a quadratic objective function defined in terms of the associated weight vector. Also, we present an algorithm for finding the (unique) lexicographically optimal base with respect to a given weight vector. Furthermore, we consider the problem of determining the set of weight vectors with respect to which a given base is lexicographically optimal and provide an algorithm for solving it, which is useful for the sensitivity analysis of the optimal base with regard to the variation of the weight vector.

The paper considers the problem of input signal selection to maximize power of an Asymptotic Locally Most Powerful (ALMP) test. It is shown that the input signal which maximizes the test power simultaneously yields maximum accuracy of identification if disturbances are Gaussian. For linear multivariable discrete-time systems described by transfer functions both the input signal optimality criterion and its gradient are derived. This allows input signal optimization by means of a gradient hill-climbing method.

"The binary tree is an important interconnection pattern for VLSI chip layouts. Suppose that the nodes are separated by at least unit distance and that a wire has unit width. The usual layout of a complete binary tree with n leaves takes chip area ( nlogn), but it can be arranged that all the leaves are on the boundary of the chip. In contrast, the “recursive H” layout has area of order n, but has only O( p n) leaves on the boundary. Thus, the recursive H layout enjoys a small area at the expense of a small number of possible I/O ports. This note shows that it is not possible to design a complete binary tree layout with area O(n) and all leaves on the boundary. More precisely, if the boundary of the chip is a convex plane curve and the leaves on the boundary are separated by at least unit distance, then area of order nlogn is necessary just to accomodate all the wires.","['Richard P.

"A basic matching problem consists of locating a reference subset in a larger set of data subject to a given criterion. Variations of the problem include template matching for object recognition, matched filtering for signal detection, image registration, change detection, cartography feature location, correlation guidance, and scene matching. In the general case the data sets may be made by completely different sensors at different geometrical orientations. A data set in N dimensions can be considered as a function in N-space. The critical subset selection problem arises when one is given a function and must select some subset of the function to match with the original. In some cases uniqueness is a key feature of the best subset. Uniqueness may be measured by the number and relative magnitudes of the peaks in the cross correlation function of the original and subset functions. For a unique subset, another desirable characteristic is lack of ambiguity. This characteristic may be measured using the correlation length or 50 percent width of the main correlation peak. The smaller the correlation length, the greater the certainty one has in detecting the correct match position. In this paper a method is presented for selecting the ``best'' subset of a scene where best is defined in terms of the minimum correlation length. The best solution is shown to be a function of the entire scene, i.e., an improper subset.","['Ernest L. Hall', 'David L. Davies', 'Michael E.

"A connected digit recognizer is proposed in which a set of isolated word templates is used as reference patterns and an unconstrained dynamic time warping algorithm is used to literally ""spot"" the digits in the string. Segmentation boundaries between digits are obtained as the termination point of the dynamic path from the previous time warp. A region around the boundary is searched for the optimum starting point for the succeeding digit. At each stage the recognizer keeps track of a set of candidate digit strings for each test string. The string with the smallest accumulated distance is used as the preliminary string estimate. For variable length digit strings of from 2 to 5 digits (where the recognizer was not told the length of the string), word error rates of about 2-3% and string error rates on the order of 8% were obtained for both speaker dependent and speaker independent systems.","['Lawrence R.

"Our group is perhaps unique in that our approach to modeling dynamic systems has a strong heritage from all three fields represented at this workshop. Each of the fields has contributed four major concepts to our modeling approach. From the Data Base field, we have adopted the idea of a single global model (data base) which defines the state of the system. Fully associative relations among typed atomic objects (no internal structure) constitute the entire state description. An information model (query language) is defined for extracting information from the state (such as one or all objects satisfying some description, or the truthfulness of some proposition). Finally, the model is updated via transactions, so that either the entire operation is completed successfully, or the state is unchanged.",['Robert Balzer'],50,,Dynamic system specification,international conference on management of data,1980,db6e3534-7573-4b76-a8e2-bd16dcf1f28b

Adaptive control using input matching can avoid the identifiability and/or exact model-matching constraints of the bulk of existing adaptive control methods. The focus on input matchability allows the use of general controller structures capable of controlling a plant whose structure may vary arbitrarily within an allowable class. The applicability of this technique is demonstrated for two simulated plants: a MIMO linear network increasing its complexity due to component failure and an unstable SISO plant controlled by an actuator which gradually develops a nonlinearity.

"An algorithm for matching images of real world scenes is presented. The matching is a specification of the geometrical disparity between the images and may be used to partially reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of the scene. Sets of candidate matching points are selected independently in each image. These points are the locations of small, distinct features which are likely to be detectable in both images. An initial network of possible matches between the two sets of candidates is constructed. Each possible match specifies a possible disparity of a candidate point in a selected reference image. An initial estimate of the probability of each possible disparity is made, based on the similarity of subimages surrounding the points. These estimates are iteratively improved by a relaxation labeling technique making use of the local continuity property of disparity that is a consequence of the continuity of real world surfaces. The algorithm is effective for binocular parallax, motion parallax, and object motion. It quickly converges to good estimates of disparity, which reflect the spatial organization of the scene.","['Stephen T. Barnard', 'William B.

"In many digital communication systems with additive noise and random interference disturbances, the error probability can be expressed as the statistical expectation of the complementary noise distribution function with respect to some function of the random interference variable Z . Conditions are presented for constructing a new class of upper and lower error bounds, utilizing an arbitrary number of generalized moments of the random interference. These bounds are based on four forms of the principal representation of Krein in the theory of approximation. General results are given for an L -level input system, an arbitrary noise distribution function, and an arbitrary transformation f(Z) . A class of simple bounds using polynomial transformations on the centered Z for the binary input system with additive Gaussian noise is presented. These bounds depend on the signal-to-noise ratio, the maximum interference distortions, the number of moments, and the polynomial transformation integer. In general the bounds obtained are very tight and need only modest computational efforts. Indeed, this approach yields the tightest possible bounds for a given set of moments of the random interference. Two techniques are discussed for evaluating principal representations as well as relationships to generalized quadrature rules. Numerical results are presented illustrating the tightness of these bounds.","['Kung Yao', 'Ezio Biglieri']",34,['b3bc9016-bb48-411d-9f75-d6104cd3a96b'],Multidimensional moment error bounds for digital communication systems,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,1980,71e9a618-ac15-403f-b059-555effb97681

We choose to approximate covariance sequences because they arise more naturally than unit pulse sequences when approximating spectra and when identifying ARMA sequences from random data. The design procedure resulting from this approach requires solution of a nonlinear algebraic equation in the form of a polynomial rootfinding problem, in addition to solving a system of linear equations and an Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT).","['A.

"This paper discusses a family of filters that have been designed for Quadrature Mirror Filter (QMF) Banks. These filters provide a significant improvement over conventional optimal equiripple and window designs when used in QMF banks. The performance criterion for these filters differ from those usually used for filter design in a way which makes the usual filter design techniques difficult to apply. Two filters are actually designed simultaneously, with constraints on the stop band rejection, transition band width, and pass and transition band performance of the QMF filter structure made from those filters. Unlike most filter design problems, the behavior of the transition band is constrained, which places unusual requirements on the design algorithm. The requirement that the overall passband behavior of the QMF bank be constrained (which is a function of the passband and stop band behavior of the filter) also places very unusual requirements on the filter design. The filters were designed using a Hooke and Jeaves optimization routine with a Hanning window prototype. Theoretical results suggest that exactly flat frequency designs cannot be created for filter lengths greater than 2, however, using the discussed procedure, one can obtain QMF banks with as little as ±.0015dB ripple in their frequency response. Due to the nature of QMF filter applications, a small set of filters can be derived which will fit most applications.",['James D.

"Over the past fourteen years the Ford Motor Company actively pursued the development and use of interactive computer graphics in the design and manufacture of automobiles. The success of Ford's pioneering efforts in the area of minicomputer graphics led to widespread acceptance and support for graphics within the corporation. This in turn led to a rapid expansion of computer graphics equipment. The advent of numerous Federal regulations in the areas of fuel economy, emissions control, and safety has generated additional Corporate interest in the use of computer graphics to help solve these difficult problems. Use of the Ford Computer Graphics System, as well as various commercially available turnkey computer graphics systems, has contributed substantially to cost reductions, improved productivity, and better documentation and control.   This paper describes the on-going computer graphics effort at Ford Motor Company. A brief history of computer graphics is presented along with a detailed description of the Ford Computer Graphics System and the commercial systems.

"In embedded multirate speech coding, it is desired to have a transmitter/receiver system that operates efficiently over a wide range of channel transmission rates. We are currently investigating a system based on adaptive transform coding of speech, in which we code and transmit the system parameters and the discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients of the fullband linear prediction residual waveform. The multirate property of the system is achieved by allowing the channel to discard some of the bits generated by the high data rate transmitter. Stripping off bits results in an absence of DCT components, which the receiver regenerates by a spectral duplication method. An inverse DCT at the receiver yields the time domain residual waveform to be used as input to the linear prediction synthesis filter. The lowest data rate achievable by the system is about 2.5 kb/s, in which case the system reduces to a narrowband LPC pitch-excited vocoder.","['Michael G.

"Abstract#R##N##R##N#Electrostatic plotter type devices, CRT or hardcopy, are basically printers which allow the ‘paper’ movement only in one direction. As a result, the entire display file has to be created before the process of generating the display can begin. This arrangement differs significantly from the X-Y plotters where the ‘plotting pencil’ and/or paper may be moved in any direction. An algorithm for generating a display on the electrostatic plotter type devices is described in this paper. This algorithm is based upon creating and maintaining a vector file consisting of end points of visible vectors, sorting these vectors, and then generating the plot—a strip at a time. Only the points that lie within the strip are calculated. The details of implementation and the data structure used are discussed. There is no restriction on the size of the display that can be generated; in fact, plots of size 100 in by 20 in have been produced using this algorithm. No a-priori knowledge of the extent of the plot is required. The algorithm has been designed to operate in a device independent computer plotting system and has worked very satisfactorily without imposing any restrictions on the users.","['Uday G. Gujar', 'J.

"This paper presents a testing strategy desiged to detect errors in the control flow of a computer program, and the conditions under which this strategy is reliable are given and characterized. The control flow statements in a computer progam partition the input space into a set of mutually exclusive domains, each of which corresponds to a particular program path and consists of input data points which cause that path to be executed. The testing strategy generates test points to examine the boundaries of a domain to detect whether a domain error has occurred, as either one or more of these boundaries will have shifted or else the corresponding predicate relational operator has changed. If test points can be chosen within e of each boundary, under the appropriate assumptions, the strategy is shown to be reliable in detecting domain errons of magnitude greater than ∈. Moreover, the number of test points required to test each domain grows only linearly with both the dimensionality of the input space and the number of predicates along the path being tested.","['Lee J.

"This paper describes methods of designing large Arithmetic and Logical Units (ALUs) using multiple Programmable Logic Array (PLA) macros in which the outputs are obtained in one cycle corresponding to one pass through any PLA. The design is based on the well-known technique of providing conditional sums and group carries in parallel and selecting the proper sum using gating circuits. The PLA for each group of bits uses an adder design published by Weinberger in which each bit of the sum is formed from the EXCLUSIVE-OR of two outputs of the OR array. By placing the gating circuits in front of the EXCLUSIVE-OR circuits, the sums can be obtained using two array outputs for each bit and one additional OR array output for each internal string of bits. Also discussed are how ALUs containing more than two groups can obtain the group carries using a separate carry-look-ahead PLA macro and how this macro can be compressed by using special decoders and special physical design layout techniques. Additionally, the paper demonstrates how the PLAs can be used to provide detection of overflow and of zero results, and to also provide Boolean operations.",['Martin S.

"Abstract   Packet broadcasting in computer communication is attractive in that it combines the advantages of both packet-switching and broadcast communication. All stations share a common channel which is multi-accessed in some random fashion. Among the various random access schemes known, carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) has been shown to be highly efficient for environmen with relatively short propagation delay. Packet broadcasting (and in particular CSMA) has been successfully applied to coaxial cables thus providing an efficient means for communication in local environments. In addition, in such environments the possibility of detecting collisions on the coaxial cable enhances the performance of CSMA by aborting conflicting transmissions, thus giving rise to the carrier sense multiple access schemes with collision detection (CSMA-CD). In this paper we extend an analysis of CSMA to accommodate collision detection. The analysis provides the throughput-delay performance of CSMA-CD and its dependence on such key system parameters as the average retransmission delay and the collision recovery time.","['Fouad A.

"A network of service stations Q 0 Q 1,...,QM is studied. Requests arrive at the centers according to independent Poisson processes; they travel through (part of) the network demanding amounts of service, with independent and negative exponentially distributed lengths, from those centers which they enter, and finally depart from the network. The waiting rooms or buffers at each service station in this exponential service system are finite. When the capacity at Q i is reached, service at all nodes which are currently processing a request destined next for Q i is instantaneously interrupted. The interruption lasts until the service of the request in the saturated node Q i is. completed. This blocking phenomenon makes an exact analysis intractable and a numerical solution computationally infeasible for most exponential systems. We introduce an approximation procedure for a class of exponential systems with blocking and show that it leads to accurate approximations for the marginal equilibrium queue length distributions.

"The general purpose graphics systems of the future will need a simple logic for visual objects—one structure underlying both text and graphics. As an experiment, perhaps the immediate handling of visual objects by the user can provide the starting point for developing that structure.

The needs of manual manipulation determine the  text-graphic pattern  as the simplest organizing structure for images; PAM stands for  P Attern  M anipulating. The PAM system is designed for the agile manipulation of text-graphic patterns—first manually, and then, later, programmatically.   Starting from this strict 'front-in' viewpoint—where immediate manipulation (hand powered animation) was to be the primary application—a 'manipulative grammar' was evolved to give the user a simple yet powerful handle on text-graphic images.

"Ring networks exhibit a number of desirable properties: they are simple in concept and in implementation; one-way point-to-point signal transmission minimizes analog circuitry and design problems; the cost of a small net is small; and transmission speed is not limited by propagation time. However, there are several potential reliability problems: all repeaters must be powered and operating reliably at all times; cutting of any transmission line in the ring will isrupt the entire network; and trouble-shooting may require visiting each node with test equipment.#R##N##R##N#The advantages of ring networks are sufficiently attractive to merit careful attack onthe reliability and maintainability problems. This paper describes a physical organization of a ring network that we term a “star-shaped ring.” This organization addresses the reliability issues mentioned above by looping all internode links back through a central location so that broken lines or repeaters can be by passed. This approach allows automatic recovery if the ring is accidentally broken. In addition, it simplifies trouble-shooting and, because the lengths of transmission links can be normalized, permits the use of still simpler transmission circuitry. Finally, the “star-shaped ring” appears to be a satisfactory approach to installing a network that can grow to a large number of nodes in a typical office building.","['Jerome H.

"A refinement of paramodulation, called hyperparamodulation, is the focus of attention in this paper. Clauses obtained by the use of this inference rule are in effect the result of a sequence of paramodulations into one common nucleus. Among the interesting properties of hyperparamodulation are: first, clauses are chosen from among the input and designated as nuclei or into clauses for paramodulation; second, terms in the nucleus are starred to restrict the domain of generalized equality substitution; third, total control is thus iteratively established over all possible targets for paramodulation during the entire run of the theorem-proving program; and fourth, application of demodulation is suspended until the hyperparamodulation completes. In contrast to these four properties which are reminiscent of the spirit of hyper-resolution, the following differences exist: first, the nucleus and the starred terms therein, which are analogous to negative literals, are determined by the user rather than by syntax; second, rather than restricting the choice of nucleus to mixed clauses, any input clause can be designated as a nucleus; and third, while hyper-resolution requires inferred clauses to be positive, no corresponding requirement exists for clauses inferred by hyperparamodulation.","['Larry Wos', 'Ross A.

The basic assumption is that the speech driving process consists of an approximately Gaussian part (unvoiced) and a jump part (voiced). The pitch pulse positions located by processing the innovations alone are known not to be very accurate due to phase-distortions, effects of zeros and inaccurate model parameter estimates. In our ladder form linear prediction recursions, a log-likelihood function is recursively computed (on-line) for each speech sample. The derivative of this log-likelihood function becomes a sensitive measure of extreme outliers of the speech waveforms, i.e., samples that very likely do not fit the Gaussian statistics. When combined with the innovations of our ladder algorithms a good statistic is obtained for locating the pitch pulses by thresholding. This pitch detection scheme has the advantage that all the necessary variables are already computed in the modeling ladder recursions and therefore is suited for fast on-line or even hardware (e.g., VLSI) implementations.","['Daniel T.

"Let \{(U_{i},V_{i})\}_{i=1}^{n} be a source of independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) discrete random variables with joint probability mass function p(u,v) and common part w=f(u)=g(v) in the sense of Witsenhausen, Gacs, and Korner. It is shown that such a source can be sent with arbitrarily small probability of error over a multiple access channel (MAC) \{\cal X_{1} \times \cal X_{2},\cal Y,p(y|x_{1},x_{2})\}, with allowed codes \{x_{l}(u), x_{2}(v)\} if there exist probability mass functions p(s), p(x_{1}|s,u),p(x_{2}|s,v) , such that H(U|V)  H(V|U )  H(U,V|W)  H(U,V)  \mbox{where}  p(s,u,v,x_{1},x_{2},y), Xl, X2, y)=p(s)p(u,v)p(x_{1}|u,s)p(x_{2}|v,s)p(y|x_{1},x_{2}). lifts region includes the multiple access channel region and the Slepian-Wolf data compression region as special cases.","['Thomas M.

"Parallel counters are multiple input circuits that count the number of their inputs that are in a given state. In this correspondence, the implementation of pipelined binary parallel counters with networks of latched quaternary threshold logic full adders is described and compared with the implementation using networks of latched binary full adders. Since each signal variable in quaternary logic may assume four logical states, twice the informational content of a binary variable, an over 50 percent savings in the total number of intermediate signal variables required to implement the parallel counter results. With the new quaternary logic circuits we will employ, over 40 percent fewer transistors and resistors are necessary for the implementation of pipelined binary parallel counters. The combination of these two factors could provide significantly reduced die areas for integrated pipelined parallel counters.",['K. W.

"A new inference control, called random sample queries, is proposed for safeguarding confidential data in on-line statistical databases. The random sample queries control deals directly with the basic principle of compromise by making it impossible for a questioner to control precisely the formation of query sets. Queries for relative frequencies and averages are computed using random samples drawn from the query sets. The sampling strategy permits the release of accurate and timely statistics and can be implemented at very low cost. Analysis shows the relative error in the statistics decreases as the query set size increases; in contrast, the effort required to compromise increases with the query set size due to large absolute errors. Experiments performed on a simulated database support the analysis.",['Dorothy E.
